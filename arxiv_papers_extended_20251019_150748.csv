Dynamic Backtracking,M. L. Ginsberg,1,"Because of their occasional need to return to shallow points in a search tree, existing backtracking methods can sometimes erase meaningful progress toward solving a search problem. In this paper, we present a method by which backtrack points can be moved deeper in the search space, thereby avoiding this difficulty. The technique developed is a variant of dependency-directed backtracking that uses only polynomial space while still providing useful control information and retaining the completeness guarantees provided by earlier approaches.",545,1993,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 1, (1993), 25-46",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,32.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9308101v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9308101v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9308101v1,cs/9308101v1
A Market-Oriented Programming Environment and its Application to Distributed Multicommodity Flow Problems,M. P. Wellman,1,"Market price systems constitute a well-understood class of mechanisms that under certain conditions provide effective decentralization of decision making with minimal communication overhead. In a market-oriented programming approach to distributed problem solving, we derive the activities and resource allocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive equilibrium of an artificial economy. WALRAS provides basic constructs for defining computational market structures, and protocols for deriving their corresponding price equilibria. In a particular realization of this approach for a form of multicommodity flow problem, we see that careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient distributed resource allocation, and that the behavior of the system can be meaningfully analyzed in economic terms.",876,1993,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 1, (1993), 1-23",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,32.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9308102v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9308102v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9308102v1,cs/9308102v1
An Empirical Analysis of Search in GSAT,"I. P. Gent, T. Walsh",2,"We describe an extensive study of search in GSAT, an approximation procedure for propositional satisfiability. GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the number of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a more complete picture of GSAT's search than previous accounts. We describe in detail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau search. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems, there is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of satisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the average gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score and average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by showing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis. This work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to improve understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms.",1075,1993,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 1, (1993), 47-59",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,32.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9309101v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9309101v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9309101v1,cs/9309101v1
The Difficulties of Learning Logic Programs with Cut,"F. Bergadano, D. Gunetti, U. Trinchero",3,"As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion, the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be restricted to purely declarative logic languages.",1120,1993,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 1, (1993), 91-107",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,32.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9311101v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9311101v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9311101v1,cs/9311101v1
Software Agents: Completing Patterns and Constructing User Interfaces,"J. C. Schlimmer, L. A. Hermens",2,"To support the goal of allowing users to record and retrieve information, this paper describes an interactive note-taking system for pen-based computers with two distinctive features. First, it actively predicts what the user is going to write. Second, it automatically constructs a custom, button-box user interface on request. The system is an example of a learning-apprentice software- agent. A machine learning component characterizes the syntax and semantics of the user's information. A performance system uses this learned information to generate completion strings and construct a user interface. Description of Online Appendix: People like to record information. Doing this on paper is initially efficient, but lacks flexibility. Recording information on a computer is less efficient but more powerful. In our new note taking softwre, the user records information directly on a computer. Behind the interface, an agent acts for the user.

Decidable Reasoning in Terminological Knowledge Representation Systems,"M. Buchheit, F. M. Donini, A. Schaerf",3,"Terminological knowledge representation systems (TKRSs) are tools for designing and using knowledge bases that make use of terminological languages (or concept languages). We analyze from a theoretical point of view a TKRS whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRSs. The new features studied, often required in practical applications, can be summarized in three main points. First, we consider a highly expressive terminological language, called ALCNR, including general complements of concepts, number restrictions and role conjunction. Second, we allow to express inclusion statements between general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular case. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction services (like satisfiability, subsumption and instance checking) through a sound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCNR-knowledge bases. Our calculus extends the general technique of constraint systems. As a byproduct of the proof, we get also the result that inclusion statements in ALCNR can be simulated by terminological cycles, if descriptive semantics is adopted.",1147,1993,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 1, (1993),

Teleo-Reactive Programs for Agent Control,N. Nilsson,1,"A formalism is presented for computing and organizing actions for autonomous agents in dynamic environments. We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R) programs whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action is based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and actual mobile robots.",939,1994,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 1, (1994),

Learning the Past Tense of English Verbs: The Symbolic Pattern Associator vs. Connectionist Models,C. X. Ling,1,"Learning the past tense of English verbs - a seemingly minor aspect of language acquisition - has generated heated debates since 1986, and has become a landmark task for testing the adequacy of cognitive modeling. Several artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been implemented, and a challenge for better symbolic models has been posed. In this paper, we present a general-purpose Symbolic Pattern Associator (SPA) based upon the decision-tree learning algorithm ID3. We conduct extensive head-to-head comparisons on the generalization ability between ANN models and the SPA under different representations. We conclude that the SPA generalizes the past tense of unseen verbs better than ANN models by a wide margin, and we offer insights as to why this should be the case. We also discuss a new default strategy for decision-tree learning algorithms.",852,1994,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 1, (1994),

Substructure Discovery Using Minimum Description Length and Background Knowledge,"D. J. Cook, L. B. Holder",2,"The ability to identify interesting and repetitive substructures is an essential component to discovering knowledge in structural data. We describe a new version of our SUBDUE substructure discovery system based on the minimum description length principle. The SUBDUE system discovers substructures that compress the original data and represent structural concepts in the data. By replacing previously-discovered substructures in the data, multiple passes of SUBDUE produce a hierarchical description of the structural regularities in the data. SUBDUE uses a computationally-bounded inexact graph match that identifies similar, but not identical, instances of a substructure and finds an approximate measure of closeness of two substructures when under computational constraints. In addition to the minimum description length principle, other background knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more appropriate substructures. Experiments in a variety of domains demonstrate SUBDUE's ability to find substructures capable of compressing the original data and to discover structural concepts important to the domain. Description of Online Appendix: This is a compressed tar file containing the SUBDUE discovery system, written in C.

Bias-Driven Revision of Logical Domain Theories,"M. Koppel, R. Feldman, A. M. Segre",3,"The theory revision problem is the problem of how best to go about revising a deficient domain theory using information contained in examples that expose inaccuracies. In this paper we present our approach to the theory revision problem for propositional domain theories. The approach described here, called PTR, uses probabilities associated with domain theory elements to numerically track the ``flow'' of proof through the theory. This allows us to measure the precise role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or undesired) derivation for a given example. This information is used to efficiently locate and repair flawed elements of the theory.

A Semantics and Complete Algorithm for Subsumption in the CLASSIC Description Logic,"A. Borgida, P. F.

In order to deal efficiently with individuals in CLASSIC descriptions, the developers have had to use an algorithm that is incomplete with respect to the standard, model-theoretic semantics for description logics. We provide a variant semantics for descriptions with respect to which the current implementation is complete, and which can be independently motivated.

Random Worlds and Maximum Entropy,"A. J. Grove, J. Y. Halpern, D. Koller",3,"Given a knowledge base KB containing first-order and statistical facts, we consider a principled method, called the random-worlds method, for computing a degree of belief that some formula Phi holds given KB. If we are reasoning about a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all possible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,...,N} that satisfy KB, and compute the fraction of them in which Phi is true. We define the degree of belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show that when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary predicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N grows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can use a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence, but is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the limitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates seems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of maximum-entropy methods.",1331,1994,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 2, (1994), 33-88",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,31.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9408101v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9408101v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9408101v1,cs/9408101v1
Pattern Matching and Discourse Processing in Information Extraction from Japanese Text,"T. Kitani, Y. Eriguchi, M. Hara",3,"Information extraction is the task of automatically picking up information of interest from an unconstrained text. Information of interest is usually extracted in two steps. First, sentence level processing locates relevant pieces of information scattered throughout the text; second, discourse processing merges coreferential information to generate the output. In the first step, pieces of information are locally identified without recognizing any relationships among them. A key word search or simple pattern search can achieve this purpose. The second step requires deeper knowledge in order to understand relationships among separately identified pieces of information. Previous information extraction systems focused on the first step, partly because they were not required to link up each piece of information with other pieces. To link the extracted pieces of information and map them onto a structured output format, complex discourse processing is essential. This paper reports on a Japanese information extraction system that merges information using a pattern matcher and discourse processor. Evaluation results show a high level of system performance which approaches human performance.",1200,1994,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 2, (1994), 89-110",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,31.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9408102v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9408102v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9408102v1,cs/9408102v1

Oblique decision tree methods are tuned especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes. We present extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate than their axis-parallel counterparts.

Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented.

We show that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the wide-spread intuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of partial-order planning.

Solving Multiclass Learning Problems via Error-Correcting Output Codes,"T. G. Dietterich, G.

The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that---like the other methods---the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates.

A Domain-Independent Algorithm for Plan Adaptation,"S. Hanks, D. S. Weld",2,"The paradigms of transformational planning, case-based planning, and plan debugging all involve a process known as plan adaptation - modifying or repairing an old plan so it solves a new problem. In this paper we provide a domain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation, demonstrate that it is sound, complete, and systematic, and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the literature. Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of partial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph's root and moves from node to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by adaptation, a library plan - an arbitrary node in the plan graph - is the starting point for the search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can apply both the same refinement operators available to a generative planner and can also retract constraints and steps from the plan. Our algorithm's completeness ensures that the adaptation algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its systematicity ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any parts of the graph.",1085,1995,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 2, (1995),

Truncating Temporal Differences: On the Efficient Implementation of TD(lambda) for Reinforcement Learning,P. Cichosz,1,"Temporal difference (TD) methods constitute a class of methods for learning predictions in multi-step prediction problems, parameterized by a recency factor lambda. Currently the most important application of these methods is to temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement learning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of TD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general implementation of TD(lambda) for arbitrary lambda, for use with reinforcement learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional approach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both inefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences) procedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates TD(lambda), but requires very little computation per action and can be used with arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is derived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far. Encouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using lambda &gt 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning speedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning.",1264,1995,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 2, (1995),

The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is the average cost of classification when using the decision tree, including both the costs of tests (features, measurements) and the costs of classification errors. ICET is compared here with three other algorithms for cost-sensitive classification - EG2, CS-ID3, and IDX - and also with C4.5, which classifies without regard to cost. The five algorithms are evaluated empirically on five real-world medical datasets. Three sets of experiments are performed. The first set examines the baseline performance of the five algorithms on the five datasets and establishes that ICET performs significantly better than its competitors. The second set tests the robustness of ICET under a variety of conditions and shows that ICET maintains its advantage. The third set looks at ICET's search in bias space and discovers a way to improve the search.",1072,1995,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 2, (1995),

Rerepresenting and Restructuring Domain Theories: A Constructive Induction Approach,"S. K. Donoho, L. A. Rendell",2,"Theory revision integrates inductive learning and background knowledge by combining training examples with a coarse domain theory to produce a more accurate theory. There are two challenges that theory revision and other theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky, cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required. Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over previous theory-guided systems. This leads to a study of the behavior, limitations, and potential of theory-guided constructive induction.",1389,1995,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 2, (1995),

Using Pivot Consistency to Decompose and Solve Functional CSPs,P. David,1,"Many studies have been carried out in order to increase the search efficiency of constraint satisfaction problems; among them, some make use of structural properties of the constraint network; others take into account semantic properties of the constraints, generally assuming that all the constraints possess the given property. In this paper, we propose a new decomposition method benefiting from both semantic properties of functional constraints (not bijective constraints) and structural properties of the network; furthermore, not all the constraints need to be functional. We show that under some conditions, the existence of solutions can be guaranteed. We first characterize a particular subset of the variables, which we name a root set. We then introduce pivot consistency, a new local consistency which is a weak form of path consistency and can be achieved in O(n^2d^2) complexity (instead of O(n^3d^3) for path consistency), and we present associated properties; in particular, we show that any consistent instantiation of the root set can be linearly extended to a solution, which leads to the presentation of the aforementioned new method for solving by decomposing functional CSPs.",1198,1995,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 2, (1995),

We first define a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing, important features of which are its stochastic nature and the purely local information available to individual agents. Given this framework, we show illuminating results on the interplay between basic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on system efficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive load balancing in heterogeneous populations, and address the issue of exploration vs. exploitation in that context.

Provably Bounded-Optimal Agents,"S. J. Russell, D. Subramanian",2,"Since its inception, artificial intelligence has relied upon a theoretical foundation centered around perfect rationality as the desired property of intelligent systems. We argue, as others have done, that this foundation is inadequate because it imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a result, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI, hindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded optimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a solution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture and the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property for a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time environments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated mail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded optimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical complexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs that are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO programs can be used as building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical basis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy, economics, and game theory.",1381,1995,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 2, (1995),

In particular, we show that a single k-ary recursive constant-depth determinate clause is learnable. Two-clause programs consisting of one learnable recursive clause and one constant-depth determinate non-recursive clause are also learnable, if an additional ``basecase'' oracle is assumed. These results immediately imply the pac-learnability of these classes. Although these classes of learnable recursive programs are very constrained, it is shown in a companion paper that they are maximally general, in that generalizing either class in any natural way leads to a computationally difficult learning problem.

In this paper we present negative results showing that any natural generalization of this class is hard to learn in Valiant's model of pac-learnability. In particular, we show that the following program classes are cryptographically hard to learn: programs with an unbounded number of constant-depth linear recursive clauses; programs with one constant-depth determinate clause containing an unbounded number of recursive calls; and programs with one linear recursive clause of constant locality. These results immediately imply the non-learnability of any more general class of programs. We also show that learning a constant-depth determinate program with either two linear recursive clauses or one linear recursive clause and one non-recursive clause is as hard as learning boolean DNF.

FLECS: Planning with a Flexible Commitment Strategy,"M. Veloso, P. Stone",2,"There has been evidence that least-commitment planners can efficiently handle planning problems that involve difficult goal interactions. This evidence has led to the common belief that delayed-commitment is the ""best"" possible planning strategy. However, we recently found evidence that eager-commitment planners can handle a variety of planning problems more efficiently, in particular those with difficult operator choices. Resigned to the futility of trying to find a universally successful planning strategy, we devised a planner that can be used to study which domains and problems are best for which planning strategies. In this article we introduce this new planning algorithm, FLECS, which uses a FLExible Commitment Strategy with respect to plan-step orderings. It is able to use any strategy from delayed-commitment to eager-commitment. The combination of delayed and eager operator-ordering commitments allows FLECS to take advantage of the benefits of explicitly using a simulated execution state and reasoning about planning constraints. FLECS can vary its commitment strategy across different problems and domains, and also during the course of a single planning problem. FLECS represents a novel contribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the choice of which commitment strategy to use while planning. FLECS provides a framework to investigate the mapping from planning domains and problems to efficient planning strategies.",1453,1995,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 3, (1995), 25-52",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,30.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9506101v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9506101v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9506101v1,cs/9506101v1

Building and Refining Abstract Planning Cases by Change of Representation Language,"R. Bergmann, W. Wilke",2,"ion is one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance of problem solvers. In several domains abstraction by dropping sentences of a domain description -- as used in most hierarchical planners -- has proven useful. In this paper we present examples which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change of representation language of planning cases from concrete to abstract. However, to achieve a powerful change of the representation language, the abstract language itself as well as rules which describe admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain model. This new abstraction approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement in an Integrated System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically learned from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning in mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning.",1273,1995,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 3, (1995), 53-118",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,30.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9507101v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9507101v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9507101v1,cs/9507101v1

In this paper, we present a new method for identifying inaccurate data on the basis of qualitative correlations among related data. First, we introduce the definitions of related data and qualitative correlations among related data. Then we put forward a new concept called support coefficient function (SCF). SCF can be used to extract, represent, and calculate qualitative correlations among related data within a dataset. We propose an approach to determining dynamic shift intervals of inaccurate data, and an approach to calculating possibility of identifying inaccurate data, respectively. Both of the approaches are based on SCF. Finally we present an algorithm for identifying inaccurate data by using qualitative correlations among related data as confirmatory or disconfirmatory evidence.

This phenomenon hurts the forward propagation of long-term context information, as well as learning a hidden state representation to represent long-term context, which depends on propagating credit information backwards in time. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that this problem of diffusion of context and credit is reduced when the transition probabilities approach 0 or 1, i.e., the transition probability matrices are sparse and the model essentially deterministic.

Improving Connectionist Energy Minimization,"G. Pinkas, R. Dechter",2,"Symmetric networks designed for energy minimization such as Boltzman machines and Hopfield nets are frequently investigated for use in optimization, constraint satisfaction and approximation of NP-hard problems. Nevertheless, finding a global solution (i.e., a global minimum for the energy function) is not guaranteed and even a local solution may take an exponential number of steps. We propose an improvement to the standard local activation function used for such networks. The improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is found in linear time for tree-like subnetworks. The algorithm, called activate, is uniform and does not assume that the network is tree-like. It can identify tree-like subnetworks even in cyclic topologies (arbitrary networks) and avoid local minima along these trees. For acyclic networks, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a global minimum from any initial state of the system (self-stabilization) and remains correct under various types of schedulers. On the negative side, we show that in the presence of cycles, no uniform algorithm exists that guarantees optimality even under a sequential asynchronous scheduler. An asynchronous scheduler can activate only one unit at a time while a synchronous scheduler can activate any number of units in a single time step. In addition, no uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when the scheduler is synchronous. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be improved using the cycle-cutset scheme. The general algorithm, called activate-with-cutset, improves over activate and has some performance guarantees that are related to the size of the network's cycle-cutset.",1677,1995,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 3, (1995),

Learning Membership Functions in a Function-Based Object Recognition System,"K. Woods, D. Cook, L. Hall, K. Bowyer, L.

Such systems naturally associate a ``measure of goodness'' or ``membership value'' with a recognized object. This measure of goodness is the result of combining individual measures, or membership values, from potentially many primitive evaluations of different properties of the object's shape. A membership function is used to compute the membership value when evaluating a primitive of a particular physical property of an object. In previous versions of a recognition system known as Gruff, the membership function for each of the primitive evaluations was hand-crafted by the system designer. In this paper, we provide a learning component for the Gruff system, called Omlet, that automatically learns membership functions given a set of example objects labeled with their desired category measure.

Flexibly Instructable Agents,"S. B. Huffman, J. E. Laird",2,"This paper presents an approach to learning from situated, interactive tutorial instruction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a flexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an instructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in whatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the agent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of instructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It combines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each instruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete explanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar that learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from interactive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key requirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous systems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point; (2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to a hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance, conditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks.",1394,1995,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 3, (1995),

Generalization of Clauses under Implication,P. Idestam-Almquist,1,"In the area of inductive learning, generalization is a main operation, and the usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently there has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in machine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform generalization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of implication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique to compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under implication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate for learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is the basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between clauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of implication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show that for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general generalization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under theta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover we show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete expansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the clause is reduced to a generalization under theta-subsumption of the expansion.",1426,1995,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 3, (1995),

Translating between Horn Representations and their Characteristic Models,R. Khardon,1,"Characteristic models are an alternative, model based, representation for Horn expressions. It has been shown that these two representations are incomparable and each has its advantages over the other. It is therefore natural to ask what is the cost of translating, back and forth, between these representations. Interestingly, the same translation questions arise in database theory, where it has applications to the design of relational databases. This paper studies the computational complexity of these problems. Our main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under polynomial reductions, and that they are equivalent to the corresponding decision problem. Namely, translating is equivalent to deciding whether a given set of models is the set of characteristic models for a given Horn expression. We also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem, a well known problem which is related to other applications in AI and for which no polynomial time algorithm is known. It is shown that in general our translation problems are at least as hard as the hypergraph transversal problem, and in a special case they are equivalent to it.",1172,1995,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 3, (1995),

The Design and Experimental Analysis of Algorithms for Temporal Reasoning,"P. vanBeek, D. W. Manchak",2,"Many applications -- from planning and scheduling to problems in molecular biology -- rely heavily on a temporal reasoning component. In this paper, we discuss the design and empirical analysis of algorithms for a temporal reasoning system based on Allen's influential interval-based framework for representing temporal information. At the core of the system are algorithms for determining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding one or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two important algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a backtracking algorithm. For the path consistency algorithm, we develop techniques that can result in up to a ten-fold speedup over an already highly optimized implementation. For the backtracking algorithm, we develop variable and value ordering heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically improve the performance of the algorithm. As well, we show that a previously suggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce the time and space requirements of the backtracking search. Taken together, the techniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning component to solve problems that are of practical size.",1242,1996,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 4, (1996), 1-18",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,29.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9601101v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9601101v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9601101v1,cs/9601101v1
Well-Founded Semantics for Extended Logic Programs with Dynamic Preferences,G. Brewka,1,The paper describes an extension of well-founded semantics for logic programs with two types of negation. In this extension information about preferences between rules can be expressed in the logical language and derived dynamically. This is achieved by using a reserved predicate symbol and a naming technique. Conflicts among rules are resolved whenever possible on the basis of derived preference information. The well-founded conclusions of prioritized logic programs can be computed in polynomial time. A legal reasoning example illustrates the usefulness of the approach.,577,1996,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 4, (1996), 19-36",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,29.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9602101v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9602101v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9602101v1,cs/9602101v1
Logarithmic-Time Updates and Queries in Probabilistic Networks,"A. L. Delcher, A. J. Grove, S. Kasif, J.

Our goal in this paper is to take a first step toward dynamic reasoning in probabilistic databases with comparable efficiency. We propose a dynamic data structure that supports efficient algorithms for updating and querying singly connected Bayesian networks. In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in O(1) time and queries are processed in time O(N), where N is the size of the network. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us to answer queries in time O(log N) at the expense of O(log N) time per evidence absorption. The usefulness of sub-linear processing time manifests itself in applications requiring (near) real-time response over large probabilistic databases.

This is done by exploiting the same aspects of problem structure as used by classical backtrack methods to avoid unproductive search choices. This quantum algorithm is much more likely to find solutions than the simple direct use of quantum parallelism. Furthermore, empirical evaluation on small problems shows this quantum algorithm displays the same phase transition behavior, and at the same location, as seen in many previously studied classical search methods.

Practical Methods for Proving Termination of General Logic Programs,E. Marchiori,1,"Termination of logic programs with negated body atoms (here called general logic programs) is an important topic. One reason is that many computational mechanisms used to process negated atoms, like Clark's negation as failure and Chan's constructive negation, are based on termination conditions. This paper introduces a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs w.r.t. the Prolog selection rule. The idea is to distinguish parts of the program depending on whether or not their termination depends on the selection rule. To this end, the notions of low-, weakly up-, and up-acceptable program are introduced. We use these notions to develop a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs, and show how interesting problems in non-monotonic reasoning can be formalized and implemented by means of terminating general logic programs.",870,1996,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 4, (1996),

Iterative Optimization and Simplification of Hierarchical Clusterings,D. Fisher,1,"Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data. Clustering systems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality and the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the search strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs a `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative optimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings. Given this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial clusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by analysts -- often according to task-specific criteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over completed patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this performance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by supervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and simplicity dimensions.",1673,1996,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 4, (1996),

Further Experimental Evidence against the Utility of Occam's Razor,G. I. Webb,1,"This paper presents new experimental evidence against the utility of Occam's razor. A~systematic procedure is presented for post-processing decision trees produced by C4.5. This procedure was derived by rejecting Occam's razor and instead attending to the assumption that similar objects are likely to belong to the same class. It increases a decision tree's complexity without altering the performance of that tree on the training data from which it is inferred. The resulting more complex decision trees are demonstrated to have, on average, for a variety of common learning tasks, higher predictive accuracy than the less complex original decision trees.

In this paper, we give a systematic treatment of the existence or non-existence of least generalizations and greatest specializations of finite sets of clauses in each of these six ordered sets. We survey results already obtained by others and also contribute some answers of our own. Our main new results are, firstly, the existence of a computable least generalization under implication of every finite set of clauses containing at least one non-tautologous function-free clause (among other, not necessarily function-free clauses). Secondly, we show that such a least generalization need not exist under relative implication, not even if both the set that is to be generalized and the background knowledge are function-free.

2Planning for Contingencies: A Decision-based Approach,"L. Pryor, G. Collins",2,"A fundamental assumption made by classical AI planners is that there is no uncertainty in the world: the planner has full knowledge of the conditions under which the plan will be executed and the outcome of every action is fully predictable. These planners cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e., plans in which different actions are performed in different circumstances. In this paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and construction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a partial-order contingency planner. Cassandra uses explicit decision-steps that enable the agent executing the plan to decide which plan branch to follow. The decision-steps in a plan result in subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are planned for in the same way as any other subgoals. Cassandra thus distinguishes the process of gathering information from the process of making decisions. The explicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent approach to the problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid base for extensions such as the use of different decision-making procedures.",1125,1996,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 4, (1996),

We refer to such systems as partially controlled multi-agent systems, and we investigate how one might influence the behavior of the uncontrolled agents through appropriate design of the controlled agents. In particular, we wish to understand which problems are naturally described in these terms, what methods can be applied to influence the uncontrollable agents, the effectiveness of such methods, and whether similar methods work across different domains. Using a game-theoretic framework, this paper studies the design of partially controlled multi-agent systems in two contexts: in one context, the uncontrollable agents are expected utility maximizers, while in the other they are reinforcement learners.

Spatial Aggregation: Theory and Applications,"K. Yip, F. Zhao",2,"Visual thinking plays an important role in scientific reasoning. Based on the research in automating diverse reasoning tasks about dynamical systems, nonlinear controllers, kinematic mechanisms, and fluid motion, we have identified a style of visual thinking, imagistic reasoning. Imagistic reasoning organizes computations around image-like, analogue representations so that perceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer structure and behavior. Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to perform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical methods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to unify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program written in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous field and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level descriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a multi-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by forming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of generic operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to perform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and successively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the neighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To illustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three implemented problem solvers -- KAM, MAPS, and HIPAIR --- in terms of the spatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of commonly used routines.",1668,1996,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 5, (1996), 1-26",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,29.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9608103v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9608103v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9608103v1,cs/9608103v1

Accelerating Partial-Order Planners: Some Techniques for Effective Search Control and Pruning,"A. Gerevini, L. Schubert",2,"We propose some domain-independent techniques for bringing well-founded partial-order planners closer to practicality. The first two techniques are aimed at improving search control while keeping overhead costs low. One is based on a simple adjustment to the default A* heuristic used by UCPOP to select plans for refinement. The other is based on preferring ``zero commitment'' (forced) plan refinements whenever possible, and using LIFO prioritization otherwise. A more radical technique is the use of operator parameter domains to prune search. These domains are initially computed from the definitions of the operators and the initial and goal conditions, using a polynomial-time algorithm that propagates sets of constants through the operator graph, starting in the initial conditions. During planning, parameter domains can be used to prune nonviable operator instances and to remove spurious clobbering threats. In experiments based on modifications of UCPOP, our improved plan and goal selection strategies gave speedups by factors ranging from 5 to more than 1000 for a variety of problems that are nontrivial for the unmodified version. Crucially, the hardest problems gave the greatest improvements. The pruning technique based on parameter domains often gave speedups by an order of magnitude or more for difficult problems, both with the default UCPOP search strategy and with our improved strategy. The Lisp code for our techniques and for the test problems is provided in on-line appendices.",1507,1996,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 5, (1996), 95-137",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,29.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9609101v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9609101v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9609101v1,cs/9609101v1
Cue Phrase Classification Using Machine Learning,D. J. Litman,1,"Cue phrases may be used in a discourse sense to explicitly signal discourse structure, but also in a sentential sense to convey semantic rather than structural information. Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit discourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and plan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning programs (Cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets of pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the generation of classification models, but also for improving upon previous results. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the literature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain new linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to automatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively analyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data. Finally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and flexible than manual methods.",1310,1996,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 5, (1996), 53-94",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,29.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9609102v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9609102v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9609102v1,cs/9609102v1
Mechanisms for Automated Negotiation in State Oriented Domains,"G. Zlotkin, J. S. Rosenschein",2,"This paper lays part of the groundwork for a domain theory of negotiation, that is, a way of classifying interactions so that it is clear, given a domain, which negotiation mechanisms and strategies are appropriate. We define State Oriented Domains, a general category of interaction. Necessary and sufficient conditions for cooperation are outlined. We use the notion of worth in an altered definition of utility, thus enabling agreements in a wider class of joint-goal reachable situations. An approach is offered for conflict resolution, and it is shown that even in a conflict situation, partial cooperative steps can be taken by interacting agents (that is, agents in fundamental conflict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain point). A Unified Negotiation Protocol (UNP) is developed that can be used in all types of encounters. It is shown that in certain borderline cooperative situations, a partial cooperative agreement (i.e., one that does not achieve all agents' goals) might be preferred by all agents, even though there exists a rational agreement that would achieve all their goals. Finally, we analyze cases where agents have incomplete information on the goals and worth of other agents. First we consider the case where agents' goals are private information, and we analyze what goal declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase their utility.

MUSE CSP: An Extension to the Constraint Satisfaction Problem,"R. A Helzerman, M. P. Harper",2,"This paper describes an extension to the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) called MUSE CSP (MUltiply SEgmented Constraint Satisfaction Problem). This extension is especially useful for those problems which segment into multiple sets of partially shared variables. Such problems arise naturally in signal processing applications including computer vision, speech processing, and handwriting recognition. For these applications, it is often difficult to segment the data in only one way given the low-level information utilized by the segmentation algorithms. MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent several similar instances of the constraint satisfaction problem. If multiple instances of a CSP have some common variables which have the same domains and constraints, then they can be combined into a single instance of a MUSE CSP, reducing the work required to apply the constraints. We introduce the concepts of MUSE node consistency, MUSE arc consistency, and MUSE path consistency. We then demonstrate how MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent lexically ambiguous sentences and the multiple sentence hypotheses that are often generated by speech recognition algorithms so that grammar constraints can be used to provide parses for all syntactically correct sentences. Algorithms for MUSE arc and path consistency are provided. Finally, we discuss how to create a MUSE CSP from a set of CSPs which are labeled to indicate when the same variable is shared by more than a single CSP.",1497,1996,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 5, (1996),

Exploiting Causal Independence in Bayesian Network Inference,"N. L. Zhang, D. Poole",2,"A new method is proposed for exploiting causal independencies in exact Bayesian network inference. A Bayesian network can be viewed as representing a factorization of a joint probability into the multiplication of a set of conditional probabilities. We present a notion of causal independence that enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain factorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as ``or'', ``sum'' or ``max'', on the contribution of each parent. We start with a simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal independence. Empirical studies, based on the CPCS networks for medical diagnosis, show that this method is more efficient than previous methods and allows for inference in larger networks than previous algorithms.",1183,1996,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 5, (1996),

SCREEN: Learning a Flat Syntactic and Semantic Spoken Language Analysis Using Artificial Neural Networks,"S. Wermter, V. Weber",2,"Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have been based on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and symbolically. While there has been some progress using statistical or connectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic component. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning robust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer, and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.",1706,1997,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 6, (1997), 35-85",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,28.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9701102v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9701102v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9701102v1,cs/9701102v1
A Uniform Framework for Concept Definitions in Description Logics,"G. DeGiacomo, M. Lenzerini",2,"Most modern formalisms used in Databases and Artificial Intelligence for describing an application domain are based on the notions of class (or concept) and relationship among classes. One interesting feature of such formalisms is the possibility of defining a class, i.e., providing a set of properties that precisely characterize the instances of the class. Many recent articles point out that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class definition containing some sort of recursion. In this paper, we argue that, instead of choosing a single style of semantics, we achieve better results by adopting a formalism that allows for different semantics to coexist. We demonstrate the feasibility of our argument, by presenting a knowledge representation formalism, the description logic muALCQ, with the above characteristics. In addition to the constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, quantifiers, and qualified number restrictions, muALCQ includes special fixpoint constructs to express (suitably interpreted) recursive definitions. These constructs enable the usual frame-based descriptions to be combined with definitions of recursive data structures such as directed acyclic graphs, lists, streams, etc. We establish several properties of muALCQ, including the decidability and the computational complexity of reasoning, by formulating a correspondence with a particular modal logic of programs called the modal mu-calculus.",1451,1997,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 6, (1997), 87-110",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,28.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9703101v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9703101v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9703101v1,cs/9703101v1

Query DAGs: A Practical Paradigm for Implementing Belief-Network Inference,"A. Darwiche, G. Provan",2,"We describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in belief networks, which consists of two steps: (1) compiling a belief network into an arithmetic expression called a Query DAG (Q-DAG); and (2) answering queries using a simple evaluation algorithm. Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a number, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the answer to a network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest. It appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms for exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using clustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a Q-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the inference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation algorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a standard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended value of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to utilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The proposed framework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different software and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation algorithm. Interestingly enough, Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes: simple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex optimization techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning and computation-caching.",1561,1997,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 6, (1997),

Connectionist Theory Refinement: Genetically Searching the Space of Network Topologies,"D. W. Opitz, J. W.

Connectionist theory-refinement systems, which use background knowledge to select a neural network's topology and initial weights, have proven to be effective at exploiting domain-specific knowledge; however, most do not exploit available computing power. This weakness occurs because they lack the ability to refine the topology of the neural networks they produce, thereby limiting generalization, especially when given impoverished domain theories. We present the REGENT algorithm which uses (a) domain-specific knowledge to help create an initial population of knowledge-based neural networks and (b) genetic operators of crossover and mutation (specifically designed for knowledge-based networks) to continually search for better network topologies.

In particular, we describe the Least-Cost Flaw Repair (LCFR) strategy developed and analyzed by Joslin and Pollack (1994), and compare it with other strategies, including Gerevini and Schubert's (1996) ZLIFO strategy. LCFR and ZLIFO make very different, and apparently conflicting claims about the most effective way to reduce search-space size in POCL planning. We resolve this conflict, arguing that much of the benefit that Gerevini and Schubert ascribe to the LIFO component of their ZLIFO strategy is better attributed to other causes. We show that for many problems, a strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with the delay of separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size, and will do so without excessive computational overhead. Although such a strategy thus provides a good default, we also show that certain domain characteristics may reduce its effectiveness.",1190,1997,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 6, (1997),

A New Look at the Easy-Hard-Easy Pattern of Combinatorial Search Difficulty,"D. L. Mammen, T.

We test the generality of this explanation by examining one of its predictions: if the number of solutions is held fixed by the choice of problems, then increased pruning should lead to a monotonic decrease in search cost. Instead, we find the easy-hard-easy pattern in median search cost even when the number of solutions is held constant, for some search methods. This generalizes previous observations of this pattern and shows that the existing theory does not explain the full range of the peak in search cost. In these cases the pattern appears to be due to changes in the size of the minimal unsolvable subproblems, rather than changing numbers of solutions.",878,1997,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 7, (1997), 47-66",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,28.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9707101v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9707101v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9707101v1,cs/9707101v1

Towards Flexible Teamwork,M. Tambe,1,"Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams for complex, dynamic multi-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such as education, training, entertainment, information integration, and collective robotics. Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter differing, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment. Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities or discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and communication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting individual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their inflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their domain-specificity hinders reusability. Our central hypothesis is that the key to such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of teamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination and communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models enable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing consistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork, called STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions (Cohen & Levesque, 1991b); teamwork in STEAM is based on agents' building up a (partial) hierarchy of joint intentions (this hierarchy is seen to parallel Grosz & Kraus's partial SharedPlans, 1996). Furthermore, in STEAM, team members monitor the team's and individual members' performance, reorganizing the team as necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM ensures reduction in communication overheads of teamwork, with appropriate sensitivity to the environmental conditions. This article describes STEAM's application in three different complex domains, and presents detailed empirical results.",1983,1997,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 7, (1997), 83-124",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,28.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9709101v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9709101v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9709101v1,cs/9709101v1

Moreover, the method's simple structure permits a proof that it operates in space and time that is linear in the size of the input.

Storing and Indexing Plan Derivations through Explanation-based Analysis of Retrieval Failures,"L. H. Ihrig, S. Kambhampati",2,"Case-Based Planning (CBP) provides a way of scaling up domain-independent planning to solve large problems in complex domains. It replaces the detailed and lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous planning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve performance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem similarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning effort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP depends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes the design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner DERSNLP+EBL. DERSNLP+EBL extends current CBP methodology by incorporating explanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from the retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision has been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library, through the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as single goal subproblems. Multi-goal problems are stored only when these smaller cases fail to be merged into a full solution.

A Model Approximation Scheme for Planning in Partially Observable Stochastic Domains,"N. L. Zhang, W. Liu",2,"Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a natural model for planning problems where effects of actions are nondeterministic and the state of the world is not completely observable. It is difficult to solve POMDPs exactly. This paper proposes a new approximation scheme. The basic idea is to transform a POMDP into another one where additional information is provided by an oracle. The oracle informs the planning agent that the current state of the world is in a certain region. The transformed POMDP is consequently said to be region observable. It is easier to solve than the original POMDP. We propose to solve the transformed POMDP and use its optimal policy to construct an approximate policy for the original POMDP. By controlling the amount of additional information that the oracle provides, it is possible to find a proper tradeoff between computational time and approximation quality. In terms of algorithmic contributions, we study in details how to exploit region observability in solving the transformed POMDP. To facilitate the study, we also propose a new exact algorithm for general POMDPs.

Dynamic Non-Bayesian Decision Making,"D. Monderer, M. Tennenholtz",2,"The model of a non-Bayesian agent who faces a repeated game with incomplete information against Nature is an appropriate tool for modeling general agent-environment interactions. In such a model the environment state (controlled by Nature) may change arbitrarily, and the feedback/reward function is initially unknown. The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a prior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his reward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action to every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are considered. In one of them -- the perfect monitoring case -- the agent is able to observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the other -- the imperfect monitoring case -- all that is available to the agent is the reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable processes, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result refers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We prove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the competitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high probability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. It is further shown that such an optimal policy does not exist in the imperfect monitoring case. Moreover, it is proved that in the perfect monitoring case there does not exist a deterministic policy that satisfies our long run optimality criterion. In addition, we discuss the maxmin criterion and prove that a deterministic efficient optimal strategy does exist in the imperfect monitoring case under this criterion. Finally we show that our approach to long-run optimality can be viewed as qualitative, which distinguishes it from previous work in this area.",1864,1997,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 7, (1997),

When Gravity Fails: Local Search Topology,"J. Frank, P. Cheeseman, J. Stutz",3,"Local search algorithms for combinatorial search problems frequently encounter a sequence of states in which it is impossible to improve the value of the objective function; moves through these regions, called plateau moves, dominate the time spent in local search. We analyze and characterize plateaus for three different classes of randomly generated Boolean Satisfiability problems. We identify several interesting features of plateaus that impact the performance of local search algorithms. We show that local minima tend to be small but occasionally may be very large. We also show that local minima can be escaped without unsatisfying a large number of clauses, but that systematically searching for an escape route may be computationally expensive if the local minimum is large. We show that plateaus with exits, called benches, tend to be much larger than minima, and that some benches have very few exit states which local search can use to escape. We show that the solutions (i.e., global minima) of randomly generated problem instances form clusters, which behave similarly to local minima. We revisit several enhancements of local search algorithms and explain their performance in light of our results. Finally we discuss strategies for creating the next generation of local search algorithms.",1306,1997,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 7, (1997),

Bidirectional Heuristic Search Reconsidered,"H. Kaindl, G. Kainz",2,"The assessment of bidirectional heuristic search has been incorrect since it was first published more than a quarter of a century ago. For quite a long time, this search strategy did not achieve the expected results, and there was a major misunderstanding about the reasons behind it. Although there is still wide-spread belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the problem of search frontiers passing each other, we demonstrate that this conjecture is wrong. Based on this finding, we present both a new generic approach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically improving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These approaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently proposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding. Empirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that bidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with limited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search appears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding unidirectional search. This provides some evidence for the usefulness of a search strategy that was long neglected. In summary, we show that bidirectional heuristic search is viable and consequently propose that it be reconsidered.",1373,1997,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 7, (1997),

Incremental Recompilation of Knowledge,"G. Gogic, C. H. Papadimitriou, M. Sideri",3,"Approximating a general formula from above and below by Horn formulas (its Horn envelope and Horn core, respectively) was proposed by Selman and Kautz (1991, 1996) as a form of ``knowledge compilation,'' supporting rapid approximate reasoning; on the negative side, this scheme is static in that it supports no updates, and has certain complexity drawbacks pointed out by Kavvadias, Papadimitriou and Sideri (1993). On the other hand, the many frameworks and schemes proposed in the literature for theory update and revision are plagued by serious complexity-theoretic impediments, even in the Horn case, as was pointed out by Eiter and Gottlob (1992), and is further demonstrated in the present paper. More fundamentally, these schemes are not inductive, in that they may lose in a single update any positive properties of the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn structure, etc.). In this paper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which combines Horn approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very efficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is represented by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the upper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and similarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact which enables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when the underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn formula by a clause. We conjecture that efficient algorithms are possible for more complex updates.",1610,1998,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 8, (1998), 23-37",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,27.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9801101v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9801101v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9801101v1,cs/9801101v1
Monotonicity and Persistence in Preferential Logics,J. Engelfriet,1,"An important characteristic of many logics for Artificial Intelligence is their nonmonotonicity. This means that adding a formula to the premises can invalidate some of the consequences. There may, however, exist formulae that can always be safely added to the premises without destroying any of the consequences: we say they respect monotonicity. Also, there may be formulae that, when they are a consequence, can not be invalidated when adding any formula to the premises: we call them conservative. We study these two classes of formulae for preferential logics, and show that they are closely linked to the formulae whose truth-value is preserved along the (preferential) ordering. We will consider some preferential logics for illustration, and prove syntactic characterization results for them. The results in this paper may improve the efficiency of theorem provers for preferential logics.",897,1998,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 8, (1998), 1-21",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,27.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9801102v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9801102v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9801102v1,cs/9801102v1
Synthesizing Customized Planners from Specifications,"B. Srivastava, S. Kambhampati",2,"Existing plan synthesis approaches in artificial intelligence fall into two categories -- domain independent and domain dependent. The domain independent approaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very efficient in any one given domain. The domain dependent approaches need to be (re)designed for each domain separately, but can be very efficient in the domain for which they are designed. One enticing alternative to these approaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the knowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis tools to support such synthesis. Specifically, we describe an architecture called CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) is used to derive a domain-customized planner through a semi-automatic combination of a declarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific to a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive domain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative theory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach by generating a class of domain-specific planners using state space refinements. Our experiments show that the synthesized planners can outperform classical refinement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP, Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We will contrast the costs and benefits of the synthesis approach with conventional methods for customizing domain independent planners.",1630,1998,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 8, (1998), 93-128",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,27.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9803101v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9803101v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9803101v1,cs/9803101v1
Cached Sufficient Statistics for Efficient Machine Learning with Large Datasets,"A. Moore, M. S. Lee",2,"This paper introduces new algorithms and data structures for quick counting for machine learning datasets. We focus on the counting task of constructing contingency tables, but our approach is also applicable to counting the number of records in a dataset that match conjunctive queries. Subject to certain assumptions, the costs of these operations can be shown to be independent of the number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of non-zero entries in the contingency table. We provide a very sparse data structure, the ADtree, to minimize memory use. We provide analytical worst-case bounds for this structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically demonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for large real-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates memory for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be deduced from other counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near its leaves. We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net structure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection algorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree methods against traditional direct counting approaches. We also discuss the possible uses of ADtrees in other machine learning methods, and discuss the merits of ADtrees in comparison with alternative representations such as kd-trees, R-trees and Frequent Sets.",1481,1998,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 8, (1998), 67-91",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,27.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9803102v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9803102v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9803102v1,cs/9803102v1
Tractability of Theory Patching,"S. Argamon-Engelson, M. Koppel",2,"In this paper we consider the problem of `theory patching', in which we are given a domain theory, some of whose components are indicated to be possibly flawed, and a set of labeled training examples for the domain concept. The theory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the theory, such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training examples. Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions are made to individual components of the theory. Our concern in this paper is to determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching problem is tractable. We consider both propositional and first-order domain theories, and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of determining what information contained in a theory is `stable' regardless of what revisions might be performed to the theory. We show that determining stability is tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions: that revisions to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification of examples, and that theory components act independently in the classification of examples in the theory. We also show how the concepts introduced can be used to determine the soundness and completeness of particular theory patching algorithms.",1317,1998,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 8, (1998), 39-65",arXiv Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,0,27.5,Artificial Intelligence,cs.AI,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9803103v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9803103v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9803103v1,cs/9803103v1
Integrative Windowing,J. Fürnkranz,1,"In this paper we re-investigate windowing for rule learning algorithms. We show that, contrary to previous results for decision tree learning, windowing can in fact achieve significant run-time gains in noise-free domains and explain the different behavior of rule learning algorithms by the fact that they learn each rule independently. The main contribution of this paper is integrative windowing, a new type of algorithm that further exploits this property by integrating good rules into the final theory right after they have been discovered. Thus it avoids re-learning these rules in subsequent iterations of the windowing process. Experimental evidence in a variety of noise-free domains shows that integrative windowing can in fact achieve substantial run-time gains. Furthermore, we discuss the problem of noise in windowing and present an algorithm that is able to achieve run-time gains in a set of experiments in a simple domain with artificial noise.",962,1998,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 8, (1998),

Model-Based Diagnosis using Structured System Descriptions,A. Darwiche,1,"This paper presents a comprehensive approach for model-based diagnosis which includes proposals for characterizing and computing preferred diagnoses, assuming that the system description is augmented with a system structure (a directed graph explicating the interconnections between system components). Specifically, we first introduce the notion of a consequence, which is a syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all consistency-based diagnoses and show that standard characterizations of diagnoses, such as minimal conflicts, correspond to syntactic variations on a consequence. Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence known as negation normal form (NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard variations. Third, we introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in NNF given a structured system description. We show that if the system structure does not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size consequence in NNF which can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show a precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences and the topology of the underlying system structure. Finally, we present an algorithm that enumerates the preferred diagnoses characterized by a consequence. The algorithm is shown to take linear time in the size of the consequence if the preference criterion satisfies some general conditions.",1439,1998,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 8, (1998),

A Selective Macro-learning Algorithm and its Application to the NxN Sliding-Tile Puzzle,"L. Finkelstein, S. Markovitch",2,"One of the most common mechanisms used for speeding up problem solvers is macro-learning. Macros are sequences of basic operators acquired during problem solving. Macros are used by the problem solver as if they were basic operators. The major problem that macro-learning presents is the vast number of macros that are available for acquisition. Macros increase the branching factor of the search space and can severely degrade problem-solving efficiency. To make macro learning useful, a program must be selective in acquiring and utilizing macros. This paper describes a general method for selective acquisition of macros. Solvable training problems are generated in increasing order of difficulty. The only macros acquired are those that take the problem solver out of a local minimum to a better state. The utility of the method is demonstrated in several domains, including the domain of NxN sliding-tile puzzles. After learning on small puzzles, the system is able to efficiently solve puzzles of any size.",1012,1998,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 8, (1998),

In a BDI model we formalize basic assumptions about dialog and cooperative behaviour of participants. These assumptions provide a basis for inferring speech acts from coherence relations between utterances and attitudes of dialog participants. Speech acts prove to be useful for determining dialog segments defined on the notion of completing expectations of dialog participants.

Prefix Probabilities from Stochastic Tree Adjoining Grammars,"Mark-Jan Nederhof, Anoop Sarkar, Giorgio Satta",3,"Language models for speech recognition typically use a probability model of the form Pr(a_n | a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}). Stochastic grammars, on the other hand, are typically used to assign structure to utterances. A language model of the above form is constructed from such grammars by computing the prefix probability Sum_{w in Sigma*} Pr(a_1 ... a_n w), where w represents all possible terminations of the prefix a_1 ... a_n. The main result in this paper is an algorithm to compute such prefix probabilities given a stochastic Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG). The algorithm achieves the required computation in O(n^6) time. The probability of subderivations that do not derive any words in the prefix, but contribute structurally to its derivation, are precomputed to achieve termination.

Conditions on Consistency of Probabilistic Tree Adjoining Grammars,Anoop Sarkar,1,"Much of the power of probabilistic methods in modelling language comes from their ability to compare several derivations for the same string in the language. An important starting point for the study of such cross-derivational properties is the notion of _consistency_. The probability model defined by a probabilistic grammar is said to be _consistent_ if the probabilities assigned to all the strings in the language sum to one. From the literature on probabilistic context-free grammars (CFGs), we know precisely the conditions which ensure that consistency is true for a given CFG. This paper derives the conditions under which a given probabilistic Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) can be shown to be consistent. It gives a simple algorithm for checking consistency and gives the formal justification for its correctness. The conditions derived here can be used to ensure that probability models that use TAGs can be checked for _deficiency_ (i.e. whether any probability mass is assigned to strings that cannot be generated).",1027,1998,In Proceedings of COLING-ACL '98 (Montreal),arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,27.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9809027v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9809027v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9809027v1,cs/9809027v1

We employ a gradual, information-based concept of ``unknownness'' providing a uniform treatment for the range of completely known to maximally unknown lexical entries. ``Unknown'' information is viewed as revisable information, which is either generalizable or specializable. Updating takes place after parsing, which only requires a modified lexical lookup. Revisable pieces of information are identified by grammar-specified declarations which provide access paths into the parse feature structure. The updating mechanism revises the corresponding places in the lexical feature structures iff the context actually provides new information. For revising generalizable information, type union is required.

It produces a finite-state oracle that efficiently restricts the constraint interpreter's search space. As a byproduct, unknown words can be analyzed without special mechanisms.

Furthermore, the representation of the meaning of words, especially of near-synonyms, is crucial, because it specifies which nuances words can convey in which contexts.",498,1998,"Proceedings of the AMTA/SIG-IL Second Workshop on Interlinguas,

Choosing the Word Most Typical in Context Using a Lexical Co-occurrence Network,Philip Edmonds,1,"This paper presents a partial solution to a component of the problem of lexical choice: choosing the synonym most typical, or expected, in context.

Comparing a statistical and a rule-based tagger for German,"Martin Volk, Gerold Schneider",2,"In this paper we present the results of comparing a statistical tagger for German based on decision trees and a rule-based Brill-Tagger for German. We used the same training corpus (and therefore the same tag-set) to train both taggers. We then applied the taggers to the same test corpus and compared their respective behavior and in particular their error rates. Both taggers perform similarly with an error rate of around 5%. From the detailed error analysis it can be seen that the rule-based tagger has more problems with unknown words than the statistical tagger. But the results are opposite for tokens that are many-ways ambiguous. If the unknown words are fed into the taggers with the help of an external lexicon (such as the Gertwol system) the error rate of the rule-based tagger drops to 4.7%, and the respective rate of the statistical taggers drops to around 3.7%. Combining the taggers by using the output of one tagger to help the other did not lead to any further improvement.",994,1998,,arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,27.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9811016v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9811016v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9811016v1,cs/9811016v1

In this paper we argue that, from an application-oriented perspective, the benefits of both are still limited. In order to improve this situation, we suggest and evaluate shallow generation methods associated with increased flexibility.

An Empirical Approach to Temporal Reference Resolution (journal version),"Janyce Wiebe, Thomas P. O'Hara, Thorsten Ohrstrom-Sandgren, Kenneth K. McKeever",4,"Scheduling dialogs, during which people negotiate the times of appointments, are common in everyday life. This paper reports the results of an in-depth empirical investigation of resolving explicit temporal references in scheduling dialogs. There are four phases of this work: data annotation and evaluation, model development, system implementation and evaluation, and model evaluation and analysis. The system and model were developed primarily on one set of data, and then applied later to a much more complex data set, to assess the generalizability of the model for the task being performed. Many different types of empirical methods are applied to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of the approach. Detailed annotation instructions were developed and an intercoder reliability study was performed, showing that naive annotators can reliably perform the targeted annotations. A fully automatic system has been developed and evaluated on unseen test data, with good results on both data sets. We adopt a pure realization of a recency-based focus model to identify precisely when it is and is not adequate for the task being addressed. In addition to system results, an in-depth evaluation of the model itself is presented, based on detailed manual annotations. The results are that few errors occur specifically due to the model of focus being used, and the set of anaphoric relations defined in the model are low in ambiguity for both data sets.",1454,1999,"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR), 9:247-293",arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,26.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9901005v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9901005v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9901005v1,cs/9901005v1
Compacting the Penn Treebank Grammar,"Alexander Krotov, Mark Hepple, Robert Gaizauskas, Yorick Wilks",4,"Treebanks, such as the Penn Treebank (PTB), offer a simple approach to obtaining a broad coverage grammar: one can simply read the grammar off the parse trees in the treebank. While such a grammar is easy to obtain, a square-root rate of growth of the rule set with corpus size suggests that the derived grammar is far from complete and that much more treebanked text would be required to obtain a complete grammar, if one exists at some limit. However, we offer an alternative explanation in terms of the underspecification of structures within the treebank. This hypothesis is explored by applying an algorithm to compact the derived grammar by eliminating redundant rules -- rules whose right hand sides can be parsed by other rules. The size of the resulting compacted grammar, which is significantly less than that of the full treebank grammar, is shown to approach a limit. However, such a compacted grammar does not yield very good performance figures. A version of the compaction algorithm taking rule probabilities into account is proposed, which is argued to be more linguistically motivated. Combined with simple thresholding, this method can be used to give a 58% reduction in grammar size without significant change in parsing performance, and can produce a 69% reduction with some gain in recall, but a loss in precision.",1335,1999,"In Proceedings of COLING-98 (Montreal), pages 699-703",arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,26.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9902001v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9902001v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9902001v1,cs/9902001v1
"The ""Fodor""-FODOR fallacy bites back",Yorick Wilks,1,"The paper argues that Fodor and Lepore are misguided in their attack on Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon, largely because their argument rests on a traditional, but implausible and discredited, view of the lexicon on which it is effectively empty of content, a view that stands in the long line of explaining word meaning (a) by ostension and then (b) explaining it by means of a vacuous symbol in a lexicon, often the word itself after typographic transmogrification. (a) and (b) both share the wrong belief that to a word must correspond a simple entity that is its meaning. I then turn to the semantic rules that Pustejovsky uses and argue first that, although they have novel features, they are in a well-established Artificial Intelligence tradition of explaining meaning by reference to structures that mention other structures assigned to words that may occur in close proximity to the first. It is argued that Fodor and Lepore's view that there cannot be such rules is without foundation, and indeed systems using such rules have proved their practical worth in computational systems. Their justification descends from line of argument, whose high points were probably Wittgenstein and Quine that meaning is not to be understood by simple links to the world, ostensive or otherwise, but by the relationship of whole cultural representational structures to each other and to the world as a whole.",1403,1999,,arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,26.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9902029v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9902029v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9902029v1,cs/9902029v1

A Formal Framework for Linguistic Annotation,"Steven Bird, Mark Liberman",2,"`Linguistic annotation' covers any descriptive or analytic notations applied to raw language data. The basic data may be in the form of time functions -- audio, video and/or physiological recordings -- or it may be textual. The added notations may include transcriptions of all sorts (from phonetic features to discourse structures), part-of-speech and sense tagging, syntactic analysis, `named entity' identification, co-reference annotation, and so on. While there are several ongoing efforts to provide formats and tools for such annotations and to publish annotated linguistic databases, the lack of widely accepted standards is becoming a critical problem. Proposed standards, to the extent they exist, have focussed on file formats. This paper focuses instead on the logical structure of linguistic annotations. We survey a wide variety of existing annotation formats and demonstrate a common conceptual core, the annotation graph. This provides a formal framework for constructing, maintaining and searching linguistic annotations, while remaining consistent with many alternative data structures and file formats.",1121,1999,,arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,26.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9903003v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9903003v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9903003v1,cs/9903003v1
Empirically Evaluating an Adaptable Spoken Dialogue System,"Diane J. Litman, Shimei Pan",2,"Recent technological advances have made it possible to build real-time, interactive spoken dialogue systems for a wide variety of applications. However, when users do not respect the limitations of such systems, performance typically degrades. Although users differ with respect to their knowledge of system limitations, and although different dialogue strategies make system limitations more apparent to users, most current systems do not try to improve performance by adapting dialogue behavior to individual users. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of TOOT, an adaptable spoken dialogue system for retrieving train schedules on the web. We conduct an experiment in which 20 users carry out 4 tasks with both adaptable and non-adaptable versions of TOOT, resulting in a corpus of 80 dialogues. The values for a wide range of evaluation measures are then extracted from this corpus. Our results show that adaptable TOOT generally outperforms non-adaptable TOOT, and that the utility of adaptation depends on TOOT's initial dialogue strategies.",1054,1999,,arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,26.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9903008v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9903008v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9903008v1,cs/9903008v1

An ascription-based approach to speech acts,"Mark Lee, Yorick Wilks",2,"The two principal areas of natural language processing research in pragmatics are belief modelling and speech act processing. Belief modelling is the development of techniques to represent the mental attitudes of a dialogue participant. The latter approach, speech act processing, based on speech act theory, involves viewing dialogue in planning terms. Utterances in a dialogue are modelled as steps in a plan where understanding an utterance involves deriving the complete plan a speaker is attempting to achieve. However, previous speech act based approaches have been limited by a reliance upon relatively simplistic belief modelling techniques and their relationship to planning and plan recognition. In particular, such techniques assume precomputed nested belief structures.

Supervised Grammar Induction Using Training Data with Limited Constituent Information,Rebecca Hwa,1,"Corpus-based grammar induction generally relies on hand-parsed training data to learn the structure of the language. Unfortunately, the cost of building large annotated corpora is prohibitively expensive. This work aims to improve the induction strategy when there are few labels in the training data. We show that the most informative linguistic constituents are the higher nodes in the parse trees, typically denoting complex noun phrases and sentential clauses. They account for only 20% of all constituents. For inducing grammars from sparsely labeled training data (e.g., only higher-level constituent labels), we propose an adaptation strategy, which produces grammars that parse almost as well as grammars induced from fully labeled corpora. Our results suggest that for a partial parser to replace human annotators, it must be able to automatically extract higher-level constituents rather than base noun phrases.",921,1999,,arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,26.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9905001v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9905001v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9905001v1,cs/9905001v1
The syntactic processing of particles in Japanese spoken language,Melanie Siegel,1,"Particles fullfill several distinct central roles in the Japanese language. They can mark arguments as well as adjuncts, can be functional or have semantic funtions. There is, however, no straightforward matching from particles to functions, as, e.g., GA can mark the subject, the object or an adjunct of a sentence. Particles can cooccur. Verbal arguments that could be identified by particles can be eliminated in the Japanese sentence. And finally, in spoken language particles are often omitted. A proper treatment of particles is thus necessary to make an analysis of Japanese sentences possible. Our treatment is based on an empirical investigation of 800 dialogues. We set up a type hierarchy of particles motivated by their subcategorizational and modificational behaviour.

In this paper we will examine seven different data representations for the problem of recognizing noun phrase chunks. We will show that the the data representation choice has a minor influence on chunking performance. However, equipped with the most suitable data representation, our memory-based learning chunker was able to improve the best published chunking results for a standard data set.",653,1999,"EACL'99, Bergen",arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,26.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9907006v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9907006v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9907006v1,cs/9907006v1
Cross-Language Information Retrieval for Technical Documents,"Atsushi Fujii, Tetsuya Ishikawa",2,"This paper proposes a Japanese/English cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) system targeting technical documents. Our system first translates a given query containing technical terms into the target language, and then retrieves documents relevant to the translated query. The translation of technical terms is still problematic in that technical terms are often compound words, and thus new terms can be progressively created simply by combining existing base words. In addition, Japanese often represents loanwords based on its phonogram. Consequently, existing dictionaries find it difficult to achieve sufficient coverage. To counter the first problem, we use a compound word translation method, which uses a bilingual dictionary for base words and collocational statistics to resolve translation ambiguity. For the second problem, we propose a transliteration method, which identifies phonetic equivalents in the target language. We also show the effectiveness of our system using a test collection for CLIR.",1019,1999,"Proceedings of the Joint ACL SIGDAT Conference on Empirical

Selective Magic HPSG Parsing,Guido Minnen,1,We propose a parser for constraint-logic grammars implementing HPSG that combines the advantages of dynamic bottom-up and advanced top-down control. The parser allows the user to apply magic compilation to specific constraints in a grammar which as a result can be processed dynamically in a bottom-up and goal-directed fashion. State of the art top-down processing techniques are used to deal with the remaining constraints. We discuss various aspects concerning the implementation of the parser as part of a grammar development system.,537,1999,"Proceedings of EACL99, Bergen, Norway, June 8-11",arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,26.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9907012v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9907012v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9907012v1,cs/9907012v1

A Bootstrap Approach to Automatically Generating Lexical Transfer Rules,"Davide Turcato, Paul McFetridge, Fred Popowich, Janine Toole",4,"We describe a method for automatically generating Lexical Transfer Rules (LTRs) from word equivalences using transfer rule templates. Templates are skeletal LTRs, unspecified for words. New LTRs are created by instantiating a template with words, provided that the words belong to the appropriate lexical categories required by the template. We define two methods for creating an inventory of templates and using them to generate new LTRs. A simpler method consists of extracting a finite set of templates from a sample of hand coded LTRs and directly using them in the generation process. A further method consists of abstracting over the initial finite set of templates to define higher level templates, where bilingual equivalences are defined in terms of correspondences involving phrasal categories. Phrasal templates are then mapped onto sets of lexical templates with the aid of grammars. In this way an infinite set of lexical templates is recursively defined. New LTRs are created by parsing input words, matching a template at the phrasal level and using the corresponding lexical categories to instantiate the lexical template. The definition of an infinite set of templates enables the automatic creation of LTRs for multi-word, non-compositional word equivalences of any cardinality.",1296,1999,,arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,26.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9907017v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9907017v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9907017v1,cs/9907017v1

Selective Sampling for Example-based Word Sense Disambiguation,"Atsushi Fujii, Kentaro Inui, Takenobu Tokunaga, Hozumi Tanaka",4,"This paper proposes an efficient example sampling method for example-based word sense disambiguation systems. To construct a database of practical size, a considerable overhead for manual sense disambiguation (overhead for supervision) is required. In addition, the time complexity of searching a large-sized database poses a considerable problem (overhead for search). To counter these problems, our method selectively samples a smaller-sized effective subset from a given example set for use in word sense disambiguation. Our method is characterized by the reliance on the notion of training utility: the degree to which each example is informative for future example sampling when used for the training of the system. The system progressively collects examples by selecting those with greatest utility. The paper reports the effectiveness of our method through experiments on about one thousand sentences. Compared to experiments with other example sampling methods, our method reduced both the overhead for supervision and the overhead for search, without the degeneration of the performance of the system.",1110,1999,"Computational Linguistics, Vol.24, No.4, pp.573-597, 1998",arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,26.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9910020v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9910020v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9910020v1,cs/9910020v1

One-Level Prosodic Morphology,Markus Walther,1,"Recent developments in theoretical linguistics have lead to a widespread acceptance of constraint-based analyses of prosodic morphology phenomena such as truncation, infixation, floating morphemes and reduplication. Of these, reduplication is particularly challenging for state-of-the-art computational morphology, since it involves copying of some part of a phonological string. In this paper I argue for certain extensions to the one-level model of phonology and morphology (Bird & Ellison 1994) to cover the computational aspects of prosodic morphology using finite-state methods. In a nutshell, enriched lexical representations provide additional automaton arcs to repeat or skip sounds and also to allow insertion of additional material. A kind of resource consciousness is introduced to control this additional freedom, distinguishing between producer and consumer arcs. The non-finite-state copying aspect of reduplication is mapped to automata intersection, itself a non-finite-state operation. Bounded local optimization prunes certain automaton arcs that fail to contribute to linguistic optimisation criteria. The paper then presents implemented case studies of Ulwa construct state infixation, German hypocoristic truncation and Tagalog over-applying reduplication that illustrate the expressive power of this approach, before its merits and limitations are discussed and possible extensions are sketched. I conclude that the one-level approach to prosodic morphology presents an attractive way of extending finite-state techniques to difficult phenomena that hitherto resisted elegant computational analyses.",1621,1999,,arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,26.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9911011v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9911011v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9911011v1,cs/9911011v1
Resolution of Indirect Anaphora in Japanese Sentences Using Examples 'X no Y (Y of X)',"M. Murata, H. Isahara, M. Nagao",3,"A noun phrase can indirectly refer to an entity that has already been mentioned. For example, ``I went into an old house last night. The roof was leaking badly and ...'' indicates that ``the roof'' is associated with `` an old house}'', which was mentioned in the previous sentence. This kind of reference (indirect anaphora) has not been studied well in natural language processing, but is important for coherence resolution, language understanding, and machine translation. In order to analyze indirect anaphora, we need a case frame dictionary for nouns that contains knowledge of the relationships between two nouns but no such dictionary presently exists. Therefore, we are forced to use examples of ``X no Y'' (Y of X) and a verb case frame dictionary instead. We tried estimating indirect anaphora using this information and obtained a recall rate of 63% and a precision rate of 68% on test sentences. This indicates that the information of ``X no Y'' is useful to a certain extent when we cannot make use of a noun case frame dictionary. We estimated the results that would be given by a noun case frame dictionary, and obtained recall and precision rates of 71% and 82% respectively. Finally, we proposed a way to construct a noun case frame dictionary by using examples of ``X no Y.''",1294,1999,"ACL'99 Workshop on 'Coreference and Its Applications', Maryland,

We also propose many new methods for estimating referents of pronouns. For example, we use the form ``X of Y'' for estimating referents of demonstrative adjectives. In addition to our new methods, we used many conventional methods.

An Estimate of Referent of Noun Phrases in Japanese Sentences,"M. Murata, M. Nagao",2,"In machine translation and man-machine dialogue, it is important to clarify referents of noun phrases. We present a method for determining the referents of noun phrases in Japanese sentences by using the referential properties, modifiers, and possessors of noun phrases. Since the Japanese language has no articles, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase has an antecedent or not. We had previously estimated the referential properties of noun phrases that correspond to articles by using clue words in the sentences. By using these referential properties, our system determined the referents of noun phrases in Japanese sentences. Furthermore we used the modifiers and possessors of noun phrases in determining the referents of noun phrases. As a result, on training sentences we obtained a precision rate of 82% and a recall rate of 85% in the determination of the referents of noun phrases that have antecedents.

Requirements of Text Processing Lexicons,K. Litkowski,1,"As text processing systems expand in scope, they will require ever larger lexicons along with a parsing capability for discriminating among many senses of a word. Existing systems do not incorporate such subtleties in meaning for their lexicons. Ordinary dictionaries contain such information, but are largely untapped.

Answer extraction systems are therefore more convenient than document retrieval systems in situations where the user wants to find specific information in limited time.   ExtrAns performs answer extraction over UNIX manpages. It has been constructed by combining available linguistic resources and implementing only a few modules from scratch. A resolution procedure between the minimal logical form of the user query and the minimal logical forms of the manpage sentences finds the answers to the queries. These answers are displayed to the user, together with pointers to the respective manpages, and the exact phrases that contribute to the answer are highlighted.   This paper shows that the increase in response times is not a big issue when scaling the system up from 30 to 500 documents, and that the response times for 500 documents are still acceptable for a real-time answer extraction system.",1108,2000,"Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems (NLDB'99).

Exploiting Diversity for Natural Language Parsing,John C. Henderson,1,"The popularity of applying machine learning methods to computational linguistics problems has produced a large supply of trainable natural language processing systems. Most problems of interest have an array of off-the-shelf products or downloadable code implementing solutions using various techniques. Where these solutions are developed independently, it is observed that their errors tend to be independently distributed. This thesis is concerned with approaches for capitalizing on this situation in a sample problem domain, Penn Treebank-style parsing.   The machine learning community provides techniques for combining outputs of classifiers, but parser output is more structured and interdependent than classifications. To address this discrepancy, two novel strategies for combining parsers are used: learning to control a switch between parsers and constructing a hybrid parse from multiple parsers' outputs.   Off-the-shelf parsers are not developed with an intention to perform well in a collaborative ensemble. Two techniques are presented for producing an ensemble of parsers that collaborate. All of the ensemble members are created using the same underlying parser induction algorithm, and the method for producing complementary parsers is only loosely constrained by that chosen algorithm.",1306,2000,,arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,25.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0006012v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0006012v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0006012v1,cs/0006012v1

A Comparison of the XTAG and CLE Grammars for English,"Beth Ann Hockey, Manny Rayner, Frankie James",3,"When people develop something intended as a large broad-coverage grammar, they usually have a more specific goal in mind. Sometimes this goal is covering a corpus; sometimes the developers have theoretical ideas they wish to investigate; most often, work is driven by a combination of these two main types of goal. What tends to happen after a while is that the community of people working with the grammar starts thinking of some phenomena as ``central'', and makes serious efforts to deal with them; other phenomena are labelled ``marginal'', and ignored. Before long, the distinction between ``central'' and ``marginal'' becomes so ingrained that it is automatic, and people virtually stop thinking about the ``marginal'' phenomena. In practice, the only way to bring the marginal things back into focus is to look at what other people are doing and compare it with one's own work. In this paper, we will take two large grammars, XTAG and the CLE, and examine each of them from the other's point of view. We will find in both cases not only that important things are missing, but that the perspective offered by the other grammar suggests simple and practical ways of filling in the holes. It turns out that there is a pleasing symmetry to the picture. XTAG has a very good treatment of complement structure, which the CLE to some extent lacks; conversely, the CLE offers a powerful and general account of adjuncts, which the XTAG grammar does not fully duplicate. If we examine the way in which each grammar does the thing it is good at, we find that the relevant methods are quite easy to port to the other framework, and in fact only involve generalization and systematization of existing mechanisms.",1706,2000,,arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,25.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0006020v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0006020v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0006020v1,cs/0006020v1

The dialogue model is based on treating the discourse structure of a conversation as a hidden Markov model and the individual dialogue acts as observations emanating from the model states. Constraints on the likely sequence of dialogue acts are modeled via a dialogue act n-gram. The statistical dialogue grammar is combined with word n-grams, decision trees, and neural networks modeling the idiosyncratic lexical and prosodic manifestations of each dialogue act.

Can Prosody Aid the Automatic Classification of Dialog Acts in Conversational Speech?,"E. Shriberg, R. Bates, A. Stolcke, P. Taylor, D. Jurafsky, K. Ries, N. Coccaro, R. Martin, M. Meteer, C. Van Ess-Dykema",10,"Identifying whether an utterance is a statement, question, greeting, and so forth is integral to effective automatic understanding of natural dialog. Little is known, however, about how such dialog acts (DAs) can be automatically classified in truly natural conversation. This study asks whether current approaches, which use mainly word information, could be improved by adding prosodic information. The study is based on more than 1000 conversations from the Switchboard corpus. DAs were hand-annotated, and prosodic features (duration, pause, F0, energy, and speaking rate) were automatically extracted for each DA. In training, decision trees based on these features were inferred; trees were then applied to unseen test data to evaluate performance. Performance was evaluated for prosody models alone, and after combining the prosody models with word information -- either from true words or from the output of an automatic speech recognizer. For an overall classification task, as well as three subtasks, prosody made significant contributions to classification. Feature-specific analyses further revealed that although canonical features (such as F0 for questions) were important, less obvious features could compensate if canonical features were removed. Finally, in each task, integrating the prosodic model with a DA-specific statistical language model improved performance over that of the language model alone, especially for the case of recognized words. Results suggest that DAs are redundantly marked in natural conversation, and that a variety of automatically extractable prosodic features could aid dialog processing in speech applications.",1658,2000,"Language and Speech 41(3-4), 439-487, 1998",arXiv Computation and Language (NLP),0,0,0,0,25.5,Computation and Language (NLP),cs.CL,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0006024v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0006024v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0006024v1,cs/0006024v1
Entropy-based Pruning of Backoff Language Models,A. Stolcke,1,"A criterion for pruning parameters from N-gram backoff language models is developed, based on the relative entropy between the original and the pruned model. It is shown that the relative entropy resulting from pruning a single N-gram can be computed exactly and efficiently for backoff models. The relative entropy measure can be expressed as a relative change in training set perplexity. This leads to a simple pruning criterion whereby all N-grams that change perplexity by less than a threshold are removed from the model. Experiments show that a production-quality Hub4 LM can be reduced to 26% its original size without increasing recognition error. We also compare the approach to a heuristic pruning criterion by Seymore and Rosenfeld (1996), and show that their approach can be interpreted as an approximation to the relative entropy criterion. Experimentally, both approaches select similar sets of N-grams (about 85% overlap), with the exact relative entropy criterion giving marginally better performance.",1017,2000,"Proceedings DARPA Broadcast News Transcription and Understanding

Prosody-Based Automatic Segmentation of Speech into Sentences and Topics,"E. Shriberg, A. Stolcke, D. Hakkani-Tur, G. Tur",4,"A crucial step in processing speech audio data for information extraction, topic detection, or browsing/playback is to segment the input into sentence and topic units. Speech segmentation is challenging, since the cues typically present for segmenting text (headers, paragraphs, punctuation) are absent in spoken language. We investigate the use of prosody (information gleaned from the timing and melody of speech) for these tasks. Using decision tree and hidden Markov modeling techniques, we combine prosodic cues with word-based approaches, and evaluate performance on two speech corpora, Broadcast News and Switchboard. Results show that the prosodic model alone performs on par with, or better than, word-based statistical language models -- for both true and automatically recognized words in news speech. The prosodic model achieves comparable performance with significantly less training data, and requires no hand-labeling of prosodic events.

"Image Compression with Iterated Function Systems, Finite Automata and Zerotrees: Grand Unification","Oleg Kiselyov, Paul Fisher",2,"Fractal image compression, Culik's image compression and zerotree prediction coding of wavelet image decomposition coefficients succeed only because typical images being compressed possess a significant degree of self-similarity. Besides the common concept, these methods turn out to be even more tightly related, to the point of algorithmical reducibility of one technique to another. The goal of the present paper is to demonstrate these relations.   The paper offers a plain-term interpretation of Culik's image compression, in regular image processing terms, without resorting to finite state machines and similar lofty language. The interpretation is shown to be algorithmically related to an IFS fractal image compression method: an IFS can be exactly transformed into Culik's image code. Using this transformation, we will prove that in a self-similar (part of an) image any zero wavelet coefficient is the root of a zerotree, or its branch.   The paper discusses the zerotree coding of (wavelet/projection) coefficients as a common predictor/corrector, applied vertically through different layers of a multiresolutional decomposition, rather than within the same view. This interpretation leads to an insight into the evolution of image compression techniques: from a causal single-layer prediction, to non-causal same-view predictions (wavelet decomposition among others) and to a causal cross-layer prediction (zero-trees, Culik's method).",1449,2000,,arXiv Computer Vision,0,0,0,0,25.5,Computer Vision,cs.CV,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0003065v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0003065v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0003065v1,cs/0003065v1

The task of estimating radial distortion is to find a radial distortion model that allows easy undistortion as well as satisfactory accuracy.

The motivation for seeking a piecewise radial distortion model is that, when a camera is resulted in a low quality during manufacturing, the nonlinear radial distortion can be complex. Using low order polynomials to approximate the radial distortion might not be precise enough. On the other hand, higher order polynomials suffer from the inverse problem. With the new piecewise radial distortion function, more flexibility is obtained and the radial undistortion can be performed analytically.

A family of simplified geometric distortion models is proposed, which are either simple polynomials or the rational functions of polynomials. Analytical geometric undistortion is possible using two of the distortion functions discussed in this paper and their performance can be improved by applying a piecewise fitting idea.

Blind Detection and Compensation of Camera Lens Geometric Distortions,"Lili Ma, YangQuan Chen, Kevin L.

Image compression by rectangular wavelet transform,Vyacheslav Zavadsky,1,"We study image compression by a separable wavelet basis $\big\{\psi(2^{k_1}x-i)\psi(2^{k_2}y-j),$ $\phi(x-i)\psi(2^{k_2}y-j),$ $\psi(2^{k_1}(x-i)\phi(y-j),$ $\phi(x-i)\phi(y-i)\big\},$ where $k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}_+$; $i,j\in\mathbb{Z}$; and $\phi,\psi$ are elements of a standard biorthogonal wavelet basis in $L_2(\mathbb{R})$. Because $k_1\ne k_2$, the supports of the basis elements are rectangles, and the corresponding transform is known as the {\em rectangular wavelet transform}. We prove that if one-dimensional wavelet basis has $M$ dual vanishing moments then the rate of approximation by $N$ coefficients of rectangular wavelet transform is $\mathcal{O}(N^{-M}\log^C N)$ for functions with mixed derivative of order $M$ in each direction.   The square wavelet transform yields the approximation rate is $\mathcal{O}(N^{-M/2})$ for functions with all derivatives of the total order $M$. Thus, the rectangular wavelet transform can outperform the square one if an image has a mixed derivative. We provide experimental comparison of image compression which shows that rectangular wavelet transform outperform the square one.",1135,2004,,arXiv Computer Vision,0,0,0,0,21.5,Computer Vision,cs.CV,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0406008v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0406008v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0406008v1,cs/0406008v1
Gradient Vector Flow Models for Boundary Extraction in 2D Images,"Gilson A. Giraldi, Leandro S. Marturelli, Paulo S. Rodrigues",3,"The Gradient Vector Flow (GVF) is a vector diffusion approach based on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). This method has been applied together with snake models for boundary extraction medical images segmentation. The key idea is to use a diffusion-reaction PDE to generate a new external force field that makes snake models less sensitivity to initialization as well as improves the snake's ability to move into boundary concavities. In this paper, we firstly review basic results about convergence and numerical analysis of usual GVF schemes. We point out that GVF presents numerical problems due to discontinuities image intensity. This point is considered from a practical viewpoint from which the GVF parameters must follow a relationship in order to improve numerical convergence. Besides, we present an analytical analysis of the GVF dependency from the parameters values. Also, we observe that the method can be used for multiply connected domains by just imposing the suitable boundary condition.

"Searching for image information content, its discovery, extraction, and representation",Emanuel Diamant,1,"Image information content is known to be a complicated and controvercial problem. This paper posits a new image information content definition. Following the theory of Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin's complexity, we define image information content as a set of descriptions of imafe data structures. Three levels of such description can be generally distinguished: 1)the global level, where the coarse structure of the entire scene is initially outlined; 2) the intermediate level, where structures of separate, non-overlapping image regions usually associated with individual scene objects are deliniated; and 3) the low-level description, where local image structures observed in a limited and restricted field of view are resolved. A technique for creating such image information content descriptors is developed.

Paving the Way for Image Understanding: A New Kind of Image Decomposition is Desired,Emanuel Diamant,1,"In this paper we present an unconventional image segmentation approach which is devised to meet the requirements of image understanding and pattern recognition tasks. Generally image understanding assumes interplay of two sub-processes: image information content discovery and image information content interpretation. Despite of its widespread use, the notion of ""image information content"" is still ill defined, intuitive, and ambiguous. Most often, it is used in the Shannon's sense, which means information content assessment averaged over the whole signal ensemble. Humans, however,rarely resort to such estimates. They are very effective in decomposing images into their meaningful constituents and focusing attention to the perceptually relevant image parts. We posit that following the latest findings in human attention vision studies and the concepts of Kolmogorov's complexity theory an unorthodox segmentation approach can be proposed that provides effective image decomposition to information preserving image fragments well suited for subsequent image interpretation.

Automatic Face Recognition System Based on Local Fourier-Bessel Features,"Yossi Zana, Roberto M. Cesar-Jr, Regis de A.

In the proposed algorithm the whole image is converted from the spatial to polar frequency domain by a Fourier-Bessel Transform (FBT). Using the whole image is compared to the case where only face image regions (local analysis) are considered. The resulting representations are embedded in a dissimilarity space, where each image is represented by its distance to all the other images, and a Pseudo-Fisher discriminator is built. Verification test results on the FERET database showed that the local-based algorithm outperforms the global-FBT version. The local-FBT algorithm performed as state-of-the-art methods under different testing conditions, indicating that the proposed system is highly robust for expression, age, and illumination variations. We also evaluated the performance of the proposed system under strong occlusion conditions and found that it is highly robust for up to 50% of face occlusion.

Face Recognition Based on Polar Frequency Features,"Yossi Zana, Roberto M. Cesar-JR",2,"A novel biologically motivated face recognition algorithm based on polar frequency is presented. Polar frequency descriptors are extracted from face images by Fourier-Bessel transform (FBT). Next, the Euclidean distance between all images is computed and each image is now represented by its dissimilarity to the other images. A Pseudo-Fisher Linear Discriminant was built on this dissimilarity space. The performance of Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) descriptors, and a combination of both feature types was also evaluated. The algorithms were tested on a 40- and 1196-subjects face database (ORL and FERET, respectively). With 5 images per subject in the training and test datasets, error rate on the ORL database was 3.8, 1.25 and 0.2% for the FBT, DFT, and the combined classifier, respectively, as compared to 2.6% achieved by the best previous algorithm. The most informative polar frequency features were concentrated at low-to-medium angular frequencies coupled to low radial frequencies. On the FERET database, where an affine normalization pre-processing was applied, the FBT algorithm outperformed only the PCA in a rank recognition test. However, it achieved performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods when evaluated by verification tests. These results indicate the high informative value of the polar frequency content of face images in relation to recognition and verification tasks, and that the Cartesian frequency content can complement information about the subjects' identity, but possibly only when the images are not pre-normalized. Possible implications for human face recognition are discussed.",1628,2005,,arXiv Computer Vision,0,0,0,0,20.5,Computer Vision,cs.CV,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0509082v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0509082v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0509082v1,cs/0509082v1

Feature vectors are composed of the pixel's intensity and continuous two-dimensional Morlet wavelet transform responses taken at multiple scales. The Morlet wavelet is capable of tuning to specific frequencies, thus allowing noise filtering and vessel enhancement in a single step. We use a Bayesian classifier with class-conditional probability density functions (likelihoods) described as Gaussian mixtures, yielding a fast classification, while being able to model complex decision surfaces and compare its performance with the linear minimum squared error classifier. The probability distributions are estimated based on a training set of labeled pixels obtained from manual segmentations. The method's performance is evaluated on publicly available DRIVE and STARE databases of manually labeled non-mydriatic images.

A decision support system for ship identification based on the curvature scale space representation,"Alvaro Enriquez de Luna, Carlos Miravet, Deitze Otaduy, Carlos Dorronsoro",4,"In this paper, a decision support system for ship identification is presented. The system receives as input a silhouette of the vessel to be identified, previously extracted from a side view of the object. This view could have been acquired with imaging sensors operating at different spectral ranges (CCD, FLIR, image intensifier). The input silhouette is preprocessed and compared to those stored in a database, retrieving a small number of potential matches ranked by their similarity to the target silhouette. This set of potential matches is presented to the system operator, who makes the final ship identification. This system makes use of an evolved version of the Curvature Scale Space (CSS) representation. In the proposed approach, it is curvature extrema, instead of zero crossings, that are tracked during silhouette evolution, hence improving robustness and enabling to cope successfully with cases where the standard CCS representation is found to be unstable. Also, the use of local curvature was replaced with the more robust concept of lobe concavity, with significant additional gains in performance.

Starting from the extreme pixel values at both ends of the histogram plot, the algorithm is applied recursively on sub-ranges computed from the previous step, so as to find a threshold level and a new sub-range for the next step, until no significant improvement in image quality can be achieved. The method makes use of the fact that a number of distributions tend towards Dirac delta function, peaking at the mean, in the limiting condition of vanishing variance. The procedure naturally provides for variable size segmentation with bigger blocks near the extreme pixel values and finer divisions around the mean or other chosen value for better visualization.

The first step in this computation of similarity is the seach of a geometrical basis of the two dimensional space where the two images are represented simultaneously after transformation of one of them. Presently, this simultaneous representation takes into account a shift and a scaling ; it may be extended to rotations or other global geometrical transformations. An elementary probabilistic computation shows that a sufficient but not excessive number of trials (a few tens) ensures that the exhibition of this common basis is guaranteed in spite of possible errors in the detection of edges. When this first step is performed, the search of similarity between the two images reduces to counting the coincidence of edges in the two images.

Total Variation Minimization and Graph Cuts for Moving Objects Segmentation,"Florent Ranchin, Antonin Chambolle, Françoise Dibos",3,"In this paper, we are interested in the application to video segmentation of the discrete shape optimization problem involving the shape weighted perimeter and an additional term depending on a parameter. Based on recent works and in particular the one of Darbon and Sigelle, we justify the equivalence of the shape optimization problem and a weighted total variation regularization. For solving this problem, we adapt the projection algorithm proposed recently for solving the basic TV regularization problem. Another solution to the shape optimization investigated here is the graph cut technique. Both methods have the advantage to lead to a global minimum. Since we can distinguish moving objects from static elements of a scene by analyzing norm of the optical flow vectors, we choose the optical flow norm as initial data. In order to have the contour as close as possible to an edge in the image, we use a classical edge detector function as the weight of the weighted total variation.

Camera motion estimation through planar deformation determination,"Claire Jonchery, Françoise Dibos, Georges Koepfler",3,"In this paper, we propose a global method for estimating the motion of a camera which films a static scene. Our approach is direct, fast and robust, and deals with adjacent frames of a sequence. It is based on a quadratic approximation of the deformation between two images, in the case of a scene with constant depth in the camera coordinate system. This condition is very restrictive but we show that provided translation and depth inverse variations are small enough, the error on optical flow involved by the approximation of depths by a constant is small. In this context, we propose a new model of camera motion, that allows to separate the image deformation in a similarity and a ``purely'' projective application, due to change of optical axis direction. This model leads to a quadratic approximation of image deformation that we estimate with an M-estimator; we can immediatly deduce camera motion parameters.",918,2006,"Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 32, 1 (2008) 73-87",arXiv Computer Vision,0,0,0,0,19.5,Computer Vision,cs.CV,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610059v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0610059v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610059v2,cs/0610059v2
A higher-order active contour model of a `gas of circles' and its application to tree crown extraction,"Peter Horvath, Ian Jermyn, Zoltan Kato, Josiane Zerubia",4,"Many image processing problems involve identifying the region in the image domain occupied by a given entity in the scene. Automatic solution of these problems requires models that incorporate significant prior knowledge about the shape of the region. Many methods for including such knowledge run into difficulties when the topology of the region is unknown a priori, for example when the entity is composed of an unknown number of similar objects. Higher-order active contours (HOACs) represent one method for the modelling of non-trivial prior knowledge about shape without necessarily constraining region topology, via the inclusion of non-local interactions between region boundary points in the energy defining the model. The case of an unknown number of circular objects arises in a number of domains, e.g. medical, biological, nanotechnological, and remote sensing imagery. Regions composed of an a priori unknown number of circles may be referred to as a `gas of circles'. In this report, we present a HOAC model of a `gas of circles'. In order to guarantee stable circles, we conduct a stability analysis via a functional Taylor expansion of the HOAC energy around a circular shape. This analysis fixes one of the model parameters in terms of the others and constrains the rest. In conjunction with a suitable likelihood energy, we apply the model to the extraction of tree crowns from aerial imagery, and show that the new model outperforms other techniques.",1469,2006,,arXiv Computer Vision,0,0,0,0,19.5,Computer Vision,cs.CV,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0611115v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0611115v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0611115v1,cs/0611115v1

Extraction of cartographic objects in high resolution satellite images for object model generation,"Guray Erus, Nicolas Loménie",2,"The aim of this study is to detect man-made cartographic objects in high-resolution satellite images. New generation satellites offer a sub-metric spatial resolution, in which it is possible (and necessary) to develop methods at object level rather than at pixel level, and to exploit structural features of objects. With this aim, a method to generate structural object models from manually segmented images has been developed. To generate the model from non-segmented images, extraction of the objects from the sample images is required. A hybrid method of extraction (both in terms of input sources and segmentation algorithms) is proposed: A region based segmentation is applied on a 10 meter resolution multi-spectral image. The result is used as marker in a ""marker-controlled watershed method using edges"" on a 2.5 meter resolution panchromatic image.

Enhancement of Noisy Planar Nuclear Medicine Images using Mean Field Annealing,"D. L. Falk, D. M. Rubin, T.

The purpose of this research is to reduce the noise and blur while maintaining image integrity for improved diagnosis. The proposed solution is to increase image quality after the standard pre- and post-processing undertaken by a gamma camera system. Mean Field Annealing (MFA) is the image processing technique used in this research. It is a computational iterative technique that makes use of the Point Spread Function (PSF) and the noise associated with the NM image. MFA is applied to NM images with the objective of reducing noise while not compromising edge integrity.

Variational local structure estimation for image super-resolution,Heng Lian,1,"Super-resolution is an important but difficult problem in image/video processing. If a video sequence or some training set other than the given low-resolution image is available, this kind of extra information can greatly aid in the reconstruction of the high-resolution image. The problem is substantially more difficult with only a single low-resolution image on hand. The image reconstruction methods designed primarily for denoising is insufficient for super-resolution problem in the sense that it tends to oversmooth images with essentially no noise.

Bandwidth selection for kernel estimation in mixed multi-dimensional spaces,"Aurelie Bugeau, Patrick Pérez",2,"Kernel estimation techniques, such as mean shift, suffer from one major drawback: the kernel bandwidth selection. The bandwidth can be fixed for all the data set or can vary at each points. Automatic bandwidth selection becomes a real challenge in case of multidimensional heterogeneous features. This paper presents a solution to this problem. It is an extension of \cite{Comaniciu03a} which was based on the fundamental property of normal distributions regarding the bias of the normalized density gradient. The selection is done iteratively for each type of features, by looking for the stability of local bandwidth estimates across a predefined range of bandwidths.

Supervised learning on graphs of spatio-temporal similarity in satellite image sequences,"Patrick Héas, Mihai Datcu",2,"High resolution satellite image sequences are multidimensional signals composed of spatio-temporal patterns associated to numerous and various phenomena. Bayesian methods have been previously proposed in (Heas and Datcu, 2005) to code the information contained in satellite image sequences in a graph representation using Bayesian methods. Based on such a representation, this paper further presents a supervised learning methodology of semantics associated to spatio-temporal patterns occurring in satellite image sequences. It enables the recognition and the probabilistic retrieval of similar events. Indeed, graphs are attached to statistical models for spatio-temporal processes, which at their turn describe physical changes in the observed scene. Therefore, we adjust a parametric model evaluating similarity types between graph patterns in order to represent user-specific semantics attached to spatio-temporal phenomena. The learning step is performed by the incremental definition of similarity types via user-provided spatio-temporal pattern examples attached to positive or/and negative semantics. From these examples, probabilities are inferred using a Bayesian network and a Dirichlet model. This enables to links user interest to a specific similarity model between graph patterns. According to the current state of learning, semantic posterior probabilities are updated for all possible graph patterns so that similar spatio-temporal phenomena can be recognized and retrieved from the image sequence.

"Graph rigidity, Cyclic Belief Propagation and Point Pattern Matching","Julian J. McAuley, Tiberio S. Caetano, Marconi S. Barbosa",3,"A recent paper \cite{CaeCaeSchBar06} proposed a provably optimal, polynomial time method for performing near-isometric point pattern matching by means of exact probabilistic inference in a chordal graphical model. Their fundamental result is that the chordal graph in question is shown to be globally rigid, implying that exact inference provides the same matching solution as exact inference in a complete graphical model. This implies that the algorithm is optimal when there is no noise in the point patterns. In this paper, we present a new graph which is also globally rigid but has an advantage over the graph proposed in \cite{CaeCaeSchBar06}: its maximal clique size is smaller, rendering inference significantly more efficient. However, our graph is not chordal and thus standard Junction Tree algorithms cannot be directly applied. Nevertheless, we show that loopy belief propagation in such a graph converges to the optimal solution. This allows us to retain the optimality guarantee in the noiseless case, while substantially reducing both memory requirements and processing time.

We do so by choosing four well-motivated state-of-the-art recognition systems for which results on the standard MNIST benchmark are available. When comparing the errors made, we observe that the errors made differ between all four systems, suggesting the use of classifier combination. We then determine the error rate of a hypothetical system that combines the output of the four systems.

Learning View Generalization Functions,Thomas M. Breuel,1,"Learning object models from views in 3D visual object recognition is usually formulated either as a function approximation problem of a function describing the view-manifold of an object, or as that of learning a class-conditional density. This paper describes an alternative framework for learning in visual object recognition, that of learning the view-generalization function. Using the view-generalization function, an observer can perform Bayes-optimal 3D object recognition given one or more 2D training views directly, without the need for a separate model acquisition step. The paper shows that view generalization functions can be computationally practical by restating two widely-used methods, the eigenspace and linear combination of views approaches, in a view generalization framework. The paper relates the approach to recent methods for object recognition based on non-uniform blurring. The paper presents results both on simulated 3D ``paperclip'' objects and real-world images from the COIL-100 database showing that useful view-generalization functions can be realistically be learned from a comparatively small number of training examples.",1158,2007,,arXiv Computer Vision,0,0,0,0,18.5,Computer Vision,cs.CV,https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0136v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.0136v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0136v1,0712.0136v1

Furthermore, it demonstrates that such systems do not require more training views than Bayes-optimal 3D model-based systems. For building computer vision systems, these results imply that using view-based or appearance-based techniques with carefully constructed combination of evidence mechanisms may not be at a disadvantage relative to 3D model-based systems. For computational approaches to human vision, they show that it is impossible to distinguish view-based and 3D model-based techniques for 3D object recognition solely by comparing the performance achievable by human and 3D model-based systems.}",918,2007,,arXiv Computer Vision,0,0,0,0,18.5,Computer Vision,cs.CV,https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0137v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.0137v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0137v1,0712.0137v1
Hierarchy construction schemes within the Scale set framework,"Jean Hugues Pruvot, Luc Brun",2,"Segmentation algorithms based on an energy minimisation framework often depend on a scale parameter which balances a fit to data and a regularising term. Irregular pyramids are defined as a stack of graphs successively reduced. Within this framework, the scale is often defined implicitly as the height in the pyramid. However, each level of an irregular pyramid can not usually be readily associated to the global optimum of an energy or a global criterion on the base level graph. This last drawback is addressed by the scale set framework designed by Guigues. The methods designed by this author allow to build a hierarchy and to design cuts within this hierarchy which globally minimise an energy. This paper studies the influence of the construction scheme of the initial hierarchy on the resulting optimal cuts. We propose one sequential and one parallel method with two variations within both. Our sequential methods provide partitions near the global optima while parallel methods require less execution times than the sequential method of Guigues even on sequential machines.",1084,2007,"Dans Graph-Based Representations in Pattern Recognition - Graph

Automatic Text Area Segmentation in Natural Images,"Syed Ali Raza Jafri, Mireille Boutin, Edward J. Delp",3,"We present a hierarchical method for segmenting text areas in natural images. The method assumes that the text is written with a contrasting color on a more or less uniform background. But no assumption is made regarding the language or character set used to write the text. In particular, the text can contain simple graphics or symbols. The key feature of our approach is that we first concentrate on finding the background of the text, before testing whether there is actually text on the background. Since uniform areas are easy to find in natural images, and since text backgrounds define areas which contain ""holes"" (where the text is written) we thus look for uniform areas containing ""holes"" and label them as text backgrounds candidates. Each candidate area is then further tested for the presence of text within its convex hull. We tested our method on a database of 65 images including English and Urdu text. The method correctly segmented all the text areas in 63 of these images, and in only 4 of these were areas that do not contain text also segmented.",1067,2008,,arXiv Computer Vision,0,0,0,0,17.5,Computer Vision,cs.CV,https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4807v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.4807v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4807v1,0801.4807v1
Wavelet and Curvelet Moments for Image Classification: Application to Aggregate Mixture Grading,"Fionn Murtagh, Jean-Luc Starck",2,"We show the potential for classifying images of mixtures of aggregate, based themselves on varying, albeit well-defined, sizes and shapes, in order to provide a far more effective approach compared to the classification of individual sizes and shapes. While a dominant (additive, stationary) Gaussian noise component in image data will ensure that wavelet coefficients are of Gaussian distribution, long tailed distributions (symptomatic, for example, of extreme values) may well hold in practice for wavelet coefficients. Energy (2nd order moment) has often been used for image characterization for image content-based retrieval, and higher order moments may be important also, not least for capturing long tailed distributional behavior. In this work, we assess 2nd, 3rd and 4th order moments of multiresolution transform -- wavelet and curvelet transform -- coefficients as features. As analysis methodology, taking account of image types, multiresolution transforms, and moments of coefficients in the scales or bands, we use correspondence analysis as well as k-nearest neighbors supervised classification.",1111,2008,"Pattern Recognition Letters, 29, 1557-1564, 2008",arXiv Computer Vision,0,0,0,0,17.5,Computer Vision,cs.CV,https://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3528v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3528v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3528v1,0802.3528v1

A New Algorithm for Interactive Structural Image Segmentation,"Alexandre Noma, Ana B. V. Graciano, Luis Augusto Consularo, Roberto M. Cesar-Jr, Isabelle Bloch",5,"This paper proposes a novel algorithm for the problem of structural image segmentation through an interactive model-based approach. Interaction is expressed in the model creation, which is done according to user traces drawn over a given input image. Both model and input are then represented by means of attributed relational graphs derived on the fly. Appearance features are taken into account as object attributes and structural properties are expressed as relational attributes. To cope with possible topological differences between both graphs, a new structure called the deformation graph is introduced. The segmentation process corresponds to finding a labelling of the input graph that minimizes the deformations introduced in the model when it is updated with input information. This approach has shown to be faster than other segmentation methods, with competitive output quality. Therefore, the method solves the problem of multiple label segmentation in an efficient way. Encouraging results on both natural and target-specific color images, as well as examples showing the reusability of the model, are presented and discussed.",1141,2008,,arXiv Computer Vision,0,0,0,0,17.5,Computer Vision,cs.CV,https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1854v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.1854v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1854v2,0805.1854v2

A general result is stated within the framework of multi-parameter exponential family.

In these applications, a recurrent problem is the lack of samples to perform an adequate estimate of the joint probabilities between element states.

Directional Cross Diamond Search Algorithm for Fast Block Motion Estimation,"Hongjun Jia, Li Zhang",2,"In block-matching motion estimation (BMME), the search patterns have a significant impact on the algorithm's performance, both the search speed and the search quality. The search pattern should be designed to fit the motion vector probability (MVP) distribution characteristics of the real-world sequences. In this paper, we build a directional model of MVP distribution to describe the directional-center-biased characteristic of the MVP distribution and the directional characteristics of the conditional MVP distribution more exactly based on the detailed statistical data of motion vectors of eighteen popular sequences. Three directional search patterns are firstly designed by utilizing the directional characteristics and they are the smallest search patterns among the popular ones. A new algorithm is proposed using the horizontal cross search pattern as the initial step and the horizontal/vertical diamond search pattern as the subsequent step for the fast BMME, which is called the directional cross diamond search (DCDS) algorithm. The DCDS algorithm can obtain the motion vector with fewer search points than CDS, DS or HEXBS while maintaining the similar or even better search quality. The gain on speedup of DCDS over CDS or DS can be up to 54.9%.

Classification of curves in 2D and 3D via affine integral signatures,"S. Feng, I. A. Kogan, H. Krim",3,"We propose a robust classification algorithm for curves in 2D and 3D, under the special and full groups of affine transformations. To each plane or spatial curve we assign a plane signature curve. Curves, equivalent under an affine transformation, have the same signature. The signatures introduced in this paper are based on integral invariants, which behave much better on noisy images than classically known differential invariants. The comparison with other types of invariants is given in the introduction. Though the integral invariants for planar curves were known before, the affine integral invariants for spatial curves are proposed here for the first time. Using the inductive variation of the moving frame method we compute affine invariants in terms of Euclidean invariants. We present two types of signatures, the global signature and the local signature. Both signatures are independent of parameterization (curve sampling). The global signature depends on the choice of the initial point and does not allow us to compare fragments of curves, and is therefore sensitive to occlusions. The local signature, although is slightly more sensitive to noise, is independent of the choice of the initial point and is not sensitive to occlusions in an image. It helps establish local equivalence of curves. The robustness of these invariants and signatures in their application to the problem of classification of noisy spatial curves extracted from a 3D object is analyzed.",1480,2008,,arXiv Computer Vision,0,0,0,0,17.5,Computer Vision,cs.CV,https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.1984v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.1984v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.1984v1,0806.1984v1

"Conceptualization of seeded region growing by pixels aggregation. Part 4: Simple, generic and robust extraction of grains in granular materials obtained by X-ray tomography",Vincent Tariel,1,"This paper proposes a simple, generic and robust method to extract the grains from experimental tridimensionnal images of granular materials obtained by X-ray tomography. This extraction has two steps: segmentation and splitting. For the segmentation step, if there is a sufficient contrast between the different components, a classical threshold procedure followed by a succession of morphological filters can be applied. If not, and if the boundary needs to be localized precisely, a watershed transformation controlled by labels is applied. The basement of this transformation is to localize a label included in the component and another label in the component complementary. A ""soft"" threshold following by an opening is applied on the initial image to localize a label in a component. For any segmentation procedure, the visualisation shows a problem: some groups of two grains, close one to each other, become connected. So if a classical cluster procedure is applied on the segmented binary image, these numerical connected grains are considered as a single grain. To overcome this problem, we applied a procedure introduced by L. Vincent in 1993. This grains extraction is tested for various complexes porous media and granular material, to predict various properties (diffusion, electrical conductivity, deformation field) in a good agreement with experiment data.",1373,2008,,arXiv Computer Vision,0,0,0,0,17.5,Computer Vision,cs.CV,https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.3939v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.3939v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.3939v2,0806.3939v2

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with the MAXQ Value Function Decomposition,Thomas G.

The paper defines the MAXQ hierarchy, proves formal results on its representational power, and establishes five conditions for the safe use of state abstractions. The paper presents an online model-free learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q, and proves that it converges wih probability 1 to a kind of locally-optimal policy known as a recursively optimal policy, even in the presence of the five kinds of state abstraction. The paper evaluates the MAXQ representation and MAXQ-Q through a series of experiments in three domains and shows experimentally that MAXQ-Q (with state abstractions) converges to a recursively optimal policy much faster than flat Q learning. The fact that MAXQ learns a representation of the value function has an important benefit: it makes it possible to compute and execute an improved, non-hierarchical policy via a procedure similar to the policy improvement step of policy iteration.

The multiplicative updating rule here constructed is natural from the homogeneous nature of the Lie group and has numerous merits for the rigorous treatment of the dynamics. As one consequence, the second order convergence is shown. For the cost function, functions invariant under the componentwise scaling are choosen. By identifying points which can be transformed to each other by the scaling, we assume that the dynamics is in a coset space. In our method, a point can move toward any direction in this coset.

Complexity analysis for algorithmically simple strings,Andrei N. Soklakov,1,"Given a reference computer, Kolmogorov complexity is a well defined function on all binary strings. In the standard approach, however, only the asymptotic properties of such functions are considered because they do not depend on the reference computer. We argue that this approach can be more useful if it is refined to include an important practical case of simple binary strings. Kolmogorov complexity calculus may be developed for this case if we restrict the class of available reference computers. The interesting problem is to define a class of computers which is restricted in a {\it natural} way modeling the real-life situation where only a limited class of computers is physically available to us. We give an example of what such a natural restriction might look like mathematically, and show that under such restrictions some error terms, even logarithmic in complexity, can disappear from the standard complexity calculus.

Robust Classification for Imprecise Environments,"Foster Provost, Tom Fawcett",2,"In real-world environments it usually is difficult to specify target operating conditions precisely, for example, target misclassification costs. This uncertainty makes building robust classification systems problematic. We show that it is possible to build a hybrid classifier that will perform at least as well as the best available classifier for any target conditions. In some cases, the performance of the hybrid actually can surpass that of the best known classifier. This robust performance extends across a wide variety of comparison frameworks, including the optimization of metrics such as accuracy, expected cost, lift, precision, recall, and workforce utilization. The hybrid also is efficient to build, to store, and to update. The hybrid is based on a method for the comparison of classifier performance that is robust to imprecise class distributions and misclassification costs. The ROC convex hull (ROCCH) method combines techniques from ROC analysis, decision analysis and computational geometry, and adapts them to the particulars of analyzing learned classifiers. The method is efficient and incremental, minimizes the management of classifier performance data, and allows for clear visual comparisons and sensitivity analyses. Finally, we point to empirical evidence that a robust hybrid classifier indeed is needed for many real-world problems.",1366,2000,,arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,25.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0009007v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0009007v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0009007v1,cs/0009007v1

Scaling Up Inductive Logic Programming by Learning from Interpretations,"Hendrik Blockeel, Luc De Raedt, Nico Jacobs, Bart Demoen",4,"When comparing inductive logic programming (ILP) and attribute-value learning techniques, there is a trade-off between expressive power and efficiency. Inductive logic programming techniques are typically more expressive but also less efficient. Therefore, the data sets handled by current inductive logic programming systems are small according to general standards within the data mining community. The main source of inefficiency lies in the assumption that several examples may be related to each other, so they cannot be handled independently.   Within the learning from interpretations framework for inductive logic programming this assumption is unnecessary, which allows to scale up existing ILP algorithms. In this paper we explain this learning setting in the context of relational databases. We relate the setting to propositional data mining and to the classical ILP setting, and show that learning from interpretations corresponds to learning from multiple relations and thus extends the expressiveness of propositional learning, while maintaining its efficiency to a large extent (which is not the case in the classical ILP setting).   As a case study, we present two alternative implementations of the ILP system Tilde (Top-down Induction of Logical DEcision trees): Tilde-classic, which loads all data in main memory, and Tilde-LDS, which loads the examples one by one. We experimentally compare the implementations, showing Tilde-LDS can handle large data sets (in the order of 100,000 examples or 100 MB) and indeed scales up linearly in the number of examples.",1579,2000,"Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 3(1), pp. 59-93, 1999",arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,25.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0011044v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011044v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0011044v1,cs/0011044v1

In this case, we need to learn a reactive policy in a highly non-Markovian domain.

Reliable and Efficient Inference of Bayesian Networks from Sparse Data by Statistical Learning Theory,"Dominik Janzing, Daniel Herrmann",2,"To learn (statistical) dependencies among random variables requires exponentially large sample size in the number of observed random variables if any arbitrary joint probability distribution can occur.   We consider the case that sparse data strongly suggest that the probabilities can be described by a simple Bayesian network, i.e., by a graph with small in-degree \Delta. Then this simple law will also explain further data with high confidence. This is shown by calculating bounds on the VC dimension of the set of those probability measures that correspond to simple graphs. This allows to select networks by structural risk minimization and gives reliability bounds on the error of the estimated joint measure without (in contrast to a previous paper) any prior assumptions on the set of possible joint measures.   The complexity for searching the optimal Bayesian networks of in-degree \Delta increases only polynomially in the number of random varibales for constant \Delta and the optimal joint measure associated with a given graph can be found by convex optimization.",1078,2003,,arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,22.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0309015v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0309015v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0309015v1,cs/0309015v1
Toward Attribute Efficient Learning Algorithms,"Adam R. Klivans, Rocco A. Servedio",2,"We make progress on two important problems regarding attribute efficient learnability.   First, we give an algorithm for learning decision lists of length $k$ over $n$ variables using $2^{\tilde{O}(k^{1/3})} \log n$ examples and time $n^{\tilde{O}(k^{1/3})}$. This is the first algorithm for learning decision lists that has both subexponential sample complexity and subexponential running time in the relevant parameters. Our approach establishes a relationship between attribute efficient learning and polynomial threshold functions and is based on a new construction of low degree, low weight polynomial threshold functions for decision lists. For a wide range of parameters our construction matches a 1994 lower bound due to Beigel for the ODDMAXBIT predicate and gives an essentially optimal tradeoff between polynomial threshold function degree and weight.   Second, we give an algorithm for learning an unknown parity function on $k$ out of $n$ variables using $O(n^{1-1/k})$ examples in time polynomial in $n$. For $k=o(\log n)$ this yields a polynomial time algorithm with sample complexity $o(n)$.

Mining Heterogeneous Multivariate Time-Series for Learning Meaningful Patterns: Application to Home Health Telecare,"Florence Duchene, Catherine Garbay, Vincent Rialle",3,"For the last years, time-series mining has become a challenging issue for researchers. An important application lies in most monitoring purposes, which require analyzing large sets of time-series for learning usual patterns.

In that paper, we propose a method for mining heterogeneous multivariate time-series for learning meaningful patterns.

Stability Analysis for Regularized Least Squares Regression,Cynthia Rudin,1,"We discuss stability for a class of learning algorithms with respect to noisy labels.

We shall call the algorithm `stable' if, when y_i is a noisy version of f*(x_i) for some function f* in H, the output of the algorithm converges to f* as the regularization term and noise simultaneously vanish. We consider two flavors of this problem, one where a data set of N points remains fixed, and the other where N -> infinity. For the case where N -> infinity, we give conditions for convergence to f_E (the function which is the expectation of y(x) for each x), as lambda -> 0. For the fixed N case, we describe the limiting 'non-noisy', 'non-regularized' function f*, and give conditions for convergence.

Defensive forecasting for linear protocols,"Vladimir Vovk, Ilia Nouretdinov, Akimichi Takemura, Glenn Shafer",4,"We consider a general class of forecasting protocols, called ""linear protocols"", and discuss several important special cases, including multi-class forecasting. Forecasting is formalized as a game between three players: Reality, whose role is to generate observations; Forecaster, whose goal is to predict the observations; and Skeptic, who tries to make money on any lack of agreement between Forecaster's predictions and the actual observations. Our main mathematical result is that for any continuous strategy for Skeptic in a linear protocol there exists a strategy for Forecaster that does not allow Skeptic's capital to grow. This result is a meta-theorem that allows one to transform any continuous law of probability in a linear protocol into a forecasting strategy whose predictions are guaranteed to satisfy this law. We apply this meta-theorem to a weak law of large numbers in Hilbert spaces to obtain a version of the K29 prediction algorithm for linear protocols and show that this version also satisfies the attractive properties of proper calibration and resolution under a suitable choice of its kernel parameter, with no assumptions about the way the data is generated.",1187,2005,,arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,20.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0506007v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0506007v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0506007v2,cs/0506007v2

To obtain such a detailed description, we consider possible decompositions of the original bag into a collection of nested bags, following a prior knowledge on the objects' structure. We then consider these smaller bags to compare two objects both in a detailed perspective, stressing local matches between the smaller bags, and in a global or coarse perspective, by considering the entire bag. This multiresolution approach is likely to be best suited for tasks where the coarse approach is not precise enough, and where a more subtle mixture of both local and global similarities is necessary to compare objects.

We prove loss bounds against an adaptive adversary. From this, we obtain a master algorithm for ""reactive"" experts problems, which means that the master's actions may influence the behavior of the adversary. Our algorithm can significantly outperform standard experts algorithms on such problems. Finally, we combine it with a universal expert class.

FPL Analysis for Adaptive Bandits,Jan Poland,1,"A main problem of ""Follow the Perturbed Leader"" strategies for online decision problems is that regret bounds are typically proven against oblivious adversary. In partial observation cases, it was not clear how to obtain performance guarantees against adaptive adversary, without worsening the bounds. We propose a conceptually simple argument to resolve this problem. Using this, a regret bound of O(t^(2/3)) for FPL in the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem is shown. This bound holds for the common FPL variant using only the observations from designated exploration rounds. Using all observations allows for the stronger bound of O(t^(1/2)), matching the best bound known so far (and essentially the known lower bound) for adversarial bandits. Surprisingly, this variant does not even need explicit exploration, it is self-stabilizing.

Learning Optimal Augmented Bayes Networks,"Vikas Hamine, Paul Helman",2,"Naive Bayes is a simple Bayesian classifier with strong independence assumptions among the attributes. This classifier, desipte its strong independence assumptions, often performs well in practice. It is believed that relaxing the independence assumptions of a naive Bayes classifier may improve the classification accuracy of the resulting structure. While finding an optimal unconstrained Bayesian Network (for most any reasonable scoring measure) is an NP-hard problem, it is possible to learn in polynomial time optimal networks obeying various structural restrictions. Several authors have examined the possibilities of adding augmenting arcs between attributes of a Naive Bayes classifier. Friedman, Geiger and Goldszmidt define the TAN structure in which the augmenting arcs form a tree on the attributes, and present a polynomial time algorithm that learns an optimal TAN with respect to MDL score. Keogh and Pazzani define Augmented Bayes Networks in which the augmenting arcs form a forest on the attributes (a collection of trees, hence a relaxation of the stuctural restriction of TAN), and present heuristic search methods for learning good, though not optimal, augmenting arc sets.

On-line regression competitive with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces,Vladimir Vovk,1,"We consider the problem of on-line prediction of real-valued labels, assumed bounded in absolute value by a known constant, of new objects from known labeled objects. The prediction algorithm's performance is measured by the squared deviation of the predictions from the actual labels. No stochastic assumptions are made about the way the labels and objects are generated. Instead, we are given a benchmark class of prediction rules some of which are hoped to produce good predictions. We show that for a wide range of infinite-dimensional benchmark classes one can construct a prediction algorithm whose cumulative loss over the first N examples does not exceed the cumulative loss of any prediction rule in the class plus O(sqrt(N)); the main differences from the known results are that we do not impose any upper bound on the norm of the considered prediction rules and that we achieve an optimal leading term in the excess loss of our algorithm. If the benchmark class is ""universal"" (dense in the class of continuous functions on each compact set), this provides an on-line non-stochastic analogue of universally consistent prediction in non-parametric statistics.

The bound is tight, as the proof leads to a simple algorithm which meets it. We further establish a bound on the total regret, E[ sum_{i=1..t} (x_i - x*)^2 ] >= O(sqrt(t)) These bounds may impose practical limitations on an agent's performance, as O(eps^-4) queries are made before the queries converge to x* with eps accuracy.",759,2005,,arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,20.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0511088v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0511088v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0511088v1,cs/0511088v1

Rational stochastic languages have minimal normal representation which may be very concise, and whose parameters can be efficiently estimated from stochastic samples.

PAC Classification based on PAC Estimates of Label Class Distributions,"Nick Palmer, Paul W.

As one might expect, the better our estimates of the label class distributions, the better the resulting classifier will be. In this paper we make this observation precise by identifying risk bounds of a classifier in terms of the quality of the estimates of the label class distributions. We show how PAC learnability relates to estimates of the distributions that have a PAC guarantee on their $L_1$ distance from the true distribution, and we bound the increase in negative log likelihood risk in terms of PAC bounds on the KL-divergence.

Using Pseudo-Stochastic Rational Languages in Probabilistic Grammatical Inference,"Amaury Habrard, Francois Denis, Yann Esposito",3,"In probabilistic grammatical inference, a usual goal is to infer a good approximation of an unknown distribution P called a stochastic language. The estimate of P stands in some class of probabilistic models such as probabilistic automata (PA). In this paper, we focus on probabilistic models based on multiplicity automata (MA). The stochastic languages generated by MA are called rational stochastic languages; they strictly include stochastic languages generated by PA; they also admit a very concise canonical representation. Despite the fact that this class is not recursively enumerable, it is efficiently identifiable in the limit by using the algorithm DEES, introduced by the authors in a previous paper. However, the identification is not proper and before the convergence of the algorithm, DEES can produce MA that do not define stochastic languages. Nevertheless, it is possible to use these MA to define stochastic languages. We show that they belong to a broader class of rational series, that we call pseudo-stochastic rational languages. The aim of this paper is twofold. First we provide a theoretical study of pseudo-stochastic rational languages, the languages output by DEES, showing for example that this class is decidable within polynomial time. Second, we have carried out a lot of experiments in order to compare DEES to classical inference algorithms such as ALERGIA and MDI.

Logical settings for concept learning from incomplete examples in First Order Logic,"Dominique Bouthinon, Henry Soldano, Véronique Ventos",3,"We investigate here concept learning from incomplete examples. Our first purpose is to discuss to what extent logical learning settings have to be modified in order to cope with data incompleteness. More precisely we are interested in extending the learning from interpretations setting introduced by L. De Raedt that extends to relational representations the classical propositional (or attribute-value) concept learning from examples framework. We are inspired here by ideas presented by H. Hirsh in a work extending the Version space inductive paradigm to incomplete data. H. Hirsh proposes to slightly modify the notion of solution when dealing with incomplete examples: a solution has to be a hypothesis compatible with all pieces of information concerning the examples. We identify two main classes of incompleteness. First, uncertainty deals with our state of knowledge concerning an example. Second, generalization (or abstraction) deals with what part of the description of the example is sufficient for the learning purpose. These two main sources of incompleteness can be mixed up when only part of the useful information is known. We discuss a general learning setting, referred to as ""learning from possibilities"" that formalizes these ideas, then we present a more specific learning setting, referred to as ""assumption-based learning"" that cope with examples which uncertainty can be reduced when considering contextual information outside of the proper description of the examples.

More specifically, for any class of prediction strategies constituting a reproducing kernel Hilbert space we construct a leading strategy, in the sense that the loss of any prediction strategy whose norm is not too large is determined by how closely it imitates the leading strategy.

In this scenario, we give a poly(n/epsilon)-time algorithm that learns the class of mixtures of any constant number of axis-aligned Gaussians in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Our algorithm makes no assumptions about the separation between the means of the Gaussians, nor does it have any dependence on the minimum mixing weight.

The hedged predictions for the labels of new objects include quantitative measures of their own accuracy and reliability. These measures are provably valid under the assumption of randomness, traditional in machine learning: the objects and their labels are assumed to be generated independently from the same probability distribution. In particular, it becomes possible to control (up to statistical fluctuations) the number of erroneous predictions by selecting a suitable confidence level. Validity being achieved automatically, the remaining goal of hedged prediction is efficiency: taking full account of the new objects' features and other available information to produce as accurate predictions as possible.

Bandit Algorithms for Tree Search,"Pierre-Arnaud Coquelin, Rémi Munos",2,"Bandit based methods for tree search have recently gained popularity when applied to huge trees, e.g. in the game of go (Gelly et al., 2006). The UCT algorithm (Kocsis and Szepesvari, 2006), a tree search method based on Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) (Auer et al., 2002), is believed to adapt locally to the effective smoothness of the tree. However, we show that UCT is too ``optimistic'' in some cases, leading to a regret O(exp(exp(D))) where D is the depth of the tree. We propose alternative bandit algorithms for tree search. First, a modification of UCT using a confidence sequence that scales exponentially with the horizon depth is proven to have a regret O(2^D \sqrt{n}), but does not adapt to possible smoothness in the tree. We then analyze Flat-UCB performed on the leaves and provide a finite regret bound with high probability. Then, we introduce a UCB-based Bandit Algorithm for Smooth Trees which takes into account actual smoothness of the rewards for performing efficient ``cuts'' of sub-optimal branches with high confidence. Finally, we present an incremental tree search version which applies when the full tree is too big (possibly infinite) to be entirely represented and show that with high probability, essentially only the optimal branches is indefinitely developed.

The second axiom requires the dimension to depend smoothly on a distance between datasets (so that the dimension of a dataset and that of an approximating principal manifold would be close to each other). The third axiom is a normalization condition: the dimension of the Euclidean $n$-sphere $\s^n$ is $\Theta(n)$.

We make four contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.",1340,2007,,arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,18.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1274v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.1274v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1274v1,0704.1274v1
Supervised Feature Selection via Dependence Estimation,"Le Song, Alex Smola, Arthur Gretton, Karsten Borgwardt, Justin Bedo",5,"We introduce a framework for filtering features that employs the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as a measure of dependence between the features and the labels.

HMM Speaker Identification Using Linear and Non-linear Merging Techniques,"Unathi Mahola, Fulufhelo V. Nelwamondo, Tshilidzi Marwala",3,"Speaker identification is a powerful, non-invasive and in-expensive biometric technique. The recognition accuracy, however, deteriorates when noise levels affect a specific band of frequency. In this paper, we present a sub-band based speaker identification that intends to improve the live testing performance. Each frequency sub-band is processed and classified independently. We also compare the linear and non-linear merging techniques for the sub-bands recognizer. Support vector machines and Gaussian Mixture models are the non-linear merging techniques that are investigated. Results showed that the sub-band based method used with linear merging techniques enormously improved the performance of the speaker identification over the performance of wide-band recognizers when tested live.

Consistency of the group Lasso and multiple kernel learning,Francis Bach,1,"We consider the least-square regression problem with regularization by a block 1-norm, i.e., a sum of Euclidean norms over spaces of dimensions larger than one. This problem, referred to as the group Lasso, extends the usual regularization by the 1-norm where all spaces have dimension one, where it is commonly referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we study the asymptotic model consistency of the group Lasso. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the consistency of group Lasso under practical assumptions, such as model misspecification. When the linear predictors and Euclidean norms are replaced by functions and reproducing kernel Hilbert norms, the problem is usually referred to as multiple kernel learning and is commonly used for learning from heterogeneous data sources and for non linear variable selection. Using tools from functional analysis, and in particular covariance operators, we extend the consistency results to this infinite dimensional case and also propose an adaptive scheme to obtain a consistent model estimate, even when the necessary condition required for the non adaptive scheme is not satisfied.",1145,2007,,arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,18.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3390v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.3390v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3390v2,0707.3390v2
Cost-minimising strategies for data labelling : optimal stopping and active learning,"Christos Dimitrakakis, Christian Savu-Krohn",2,"Supervised learning deals with the inference of a distribution over an output or label space $\CY$ conditioned on points in an observation space $\CX$, given a training dataset $D$ of pairs in $\CX \times \CY$. However, in a lot of applications of interest, acquisition of large amounts of observations is easy, while the process of generating labels is time-consuming or costly. One way to deal with this problem is {\em active} learning, where points to be labelled are selected with the aim of creating a model with better performance than that of an model trained on an equal number of randomly sampled points. In this paper, we instead propose to deal with the labelling cost directly: The learning goal is defined as the minimisation of a cost which is a function of the expected model performance and the total cost of the labels used. This allows the development of general strategies and specific algorithms for (a) optimal stopping, where the expected cost dictates whether label acquisition should continue (b) empirical evaluation, where the cost is used as a performance metric for a given combination of inference, stopping and sampling methods.

On the Relationship between the Posterior and Optimal Similarity,Thomas M. Breuel,1,"For a classification problem described by the joint density $P(\omega,x)$, models of $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$ (the ``Bayesian similarity measure'') have been shown to be an optimal similarity measure for nearest neighbor classification. This paper analyzes demonstrates several additional properties of that conditional distribution. The paper first shows that we can reconstruct, up to class labels, the class posterior distribution $P(\omega|x)$ given $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$, gives a procedure for recovering the class labels, and gives an asymptotically Bayes-optimal classification procedure. It also shows, given such an optimal similarity measure, how to construct a classifier that outperforms the nearest neighbor classifier and achieves Bayes-optimal classification rates. The paper then analyzes Bayesian similarity in a framework where a classifier faces a number of related classification tasks (multitask learning) and illustrates that reconstruction of the class posterior distribution is not possible in general. Finally, the paper identifies a distinct class of classification problems using $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$ and shows that using $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$ to solve those problems is the Bayes optimal solution.",1243,2007,,arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,18.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0130v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.0130v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0130v1,0712.0130v1
Equations of States in Singular Statistical Estimation,Sumio Watanabe,1,"Learning machines which have hierarchical structures or hidden variables are singular statistical models because they are nonidentifiable and their Fisher information matrices are singular. In singular statistical models, neither the Bayes a posteriori distribution converges to the normal distribution nor the maximum likelihood estimator satisfies asymptotic normality. This is the main reason why it has been difficult to predict their generalization performances from trained states. In this paper, we study four errors, (1) Bayes generalization error, (2) Bayes training error, (3) Gibbs generalization error, and (4) Gibbs training error, and prove that there are mathematical relations among these errors. The formulas proved in this paper are equations of states in statistical estimation because they hold for any true distribution, any parametric model, and any a priori distribution.

The Scheffe tournament estimate requires fewer computations than the minimum distance estimate, but has strictly weaker guarantees than the latter.   We focus on the computational aspect of density estimation. We present two algorithms, both with the same guarantee as the minimum distance estimate. The first one, a modification of the minimum distance estimate, uses the same number (quadratic in |F|) of computations as the Scheffe tournament.

It was found that as the ensemble became diverse the accuracy improved. However at a certain diversity measure the accuracy began to drop. The Kohavi-Wolpert variance method is used to measure the diversity of the ensemble. A method of voting is used to aggregate the results from each classifier.

A Quadratic Loss Multi-Class SVM,"Emmanuel Monfrini, Yann Guermeur",2,"Using a support vector machine requires to set two types of hyperparameters: the soft margin parameter C and the parameters of the kernel. To perform this model selection task, the method of choice is cross-validation. Its leave-one-out variant is known to produce an estimator of the generalization error which is almost unbiased. Its major drawback rests in its time requirement. To overcome this difficulty, several upper bounds on the leave-one-out error of the pattern recognition SVM have been derived. Among those bounds, the most popular one is probably the radius-margin bound. It applies to the hard margin pattern recognition SVM, and by extension to the 2-norm SVM.

Sample Selection Bias Correction Theory,"Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri, Michael Riley, Afshin Rostamizadeh",4,This paper presents a theoretical analysis of sample selection bias correction. The sample bias correction technique commonly used in machine learning consists of reweighting the cost of an error on each training point of a biased sample to more closely reflect the unbiased distribution. This relies on weights derived by various estimation techniques based on finite samples. We analyze the effect of an error in that estimation on the accuracy of the hypothesis returned by the learning algorithm for two estimation techniques: a cluster-based estimation technique and kernel mean matching. We also report the results of sample bias correction experiments with several data sets using these techniques. Our analysis is based on the novel concept of distributional stability which generalizes the existing concept of point-based stability.

Statistical Learning of Arbitrary Computable Classifiers,David Soloveichik,1,"Statistical learning theory chiefly studies restricted hypothesis classes, particularly those with finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. The fundamental quantity of interest is the sample complexity: the number of samples required to learn to a specified level of accuracy. Here we consider learning over the set of all computable labeling functions. Since the VC-dimension is infinite and a priori (uniform) bounds on the number of samples are impossible, we let the learning algorithm decide when it has seen sufficient samples to have learned. We first show that learning in this setting is indeed possible, and develop a learning algorithm. We then show, however, that bounding sample complexity independently of the distribution is impossible. Notably, this impossibility is entirely due to the requirement that the learning algorithm be computable, and not due to the statistical nature of the problem.",913,2008,,arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,17.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.3537v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.3537v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.3537v2,0806.3537v2

Computationally Efficient Estimators for Dimension Reductions Using Stable Random Projections,Ping Li,1,"The method of stable random projections is a tool for efficiently computing the $l_\alpha$ distances using low memory, where $0<\alpha \leq 2$ is a tuning parameter. The method boils down to a statistical estimation task and various estimators have been proposed, based on the geometric mean, the harmonic mean, and the fractional power etc.   This study proposes the optimal quantile estimator, whose main operation is selecting, which is considerably less expensive than taking fractional power, the main operation in previous estimators. Our experiments report that the optimal quantile estimator is nearly one order of magnitude more computationally efficient than previous estimators. For large-scale learning tasks in which storing and computing pairwise distances is a serious bottleneck, this estimator should be desirable.   In addition to its computational advantages, the optimal quantile estimator exhibits nice theoretical properties. It is more accurate than previous estimators when $\alpha>1$. We derive its theoretical error bounds and establish the explicit (i.e., no hidden constants) sample complexity bound.",1128,2008,,arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,17.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4422v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.4422v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4422v1,0806.4422v1
On Approximating the Lp Distances for p>2,Ping Li,1,"Applications in machine learning and data mining require computing pairwise Lp distances in a data matrix A. For massive high-dimensional data, computing all pairwise distances of A can be infeasible. In fact, even storing A or all pairwise distances of A in the memory may be also infeasible. This paper proposes a simple method for p = 2, 4, 6, ... We first decompose the l_p (where p is even) distances into a sum of 2 marginal norms and p-1 ``inner products'' at different orders. Then we apply normal or sub-Gaussian random projections to approximate the resultant ``inner products,'' assuming that the marginal norms can be computed exactly by a linear scan. We propose two strategies for applying random projections. The basic projection strategy requires only one projection matrix but it is more difficult to analyze, while the alternative projection strategy requires p-1 projection matrices but its theoretical analysis is much easier. In terms of the accuracy, at least for p=4, the basic strategy is always more accurate than the alternative strategy if the data are non-negative, which is common in reality.",1121,2008,,arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,17.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4423v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.4423v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4423v1,0806.4423v1

"On Probability Distributions for Trees: Representations, Inference and Learning","François Denis, Amaury Habrard, Rémi Gilleron, Marc Tommasi, Édouard Gilbert",5,"We study probability distributions over free algebras of trees. Probability distributions can be seen as particular (formal power) tree series [Berstel et al 82, Esik et al 03], i.e. mappings from trees to a semiring K . A widely studied class of tree series is the class of rational (or recognizable) tree series which can be defined either in an algebraic way or by means of multiplicity tree automata. We argue that the algebraic representation is very convenient to model probability distributions over a free algebra of trees. First, as in the string case, the algebraic representation allows to design learning algorithms for the whole class of probability distributions defined by rational tree series. Note that learning algorithms for rational tree series correspond to learning algorithms for weighted tree automata where both the structure and the weights are learned. Second, the algebraic representation can be easily extended to deal with unranked trees (like XML trees where a symbol may have an unbounded number of children). Both properties are particularly relevant for applications: nondeterministic automata are required for the inference problem to be relevant (recall that Hidden Markov Models are equivalent to nondeterministic string automata); nowadays applications for Web Information Extraction, Web Services and document processing consider unranked trees.",1384,2008,"Dans NIPS Workshop on Representations and Inference on Probability

Positive factor networks: A graphical framework for modeling non-negative sequential data,Brian K. Vogel,1,"We present a novel graphical framework for modeling non-negative sequential data with hierarchical structure. Our model corresponds to a network of coupled non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) modules, which we refer to as a positive factor network (PFN). The data model is linear, subject to non-negativity constraints, so that observation data consisting of an additive combination of individually representable observations is also representable by the network. This is a desirable property for modeling problems in computational auditory scene analysis, since distinct sound sources in the environment are often well-modeled as combining additively in the corresponding magnitude spectrogram. We propose inference and learning algorithms that leverage existing NMF algorithms and that are straightforward to implement. We present a target tracking example and provide results for synthetic observation data which serve to illustrate the interesting properties of PFNs and motivate their potential usefulness in applications such as music transcription, source separation, and speech recognition. We show how a target process characterized by a hierarchical state transition model can be represented as a PFN. Our results illustrate that a PFN which is defined in terms of a single target observation can then be used to effectively track the states of multiple simultaneous targets. Our results show that the quality of the inferred target states degrades gradually as the observation noise is increased. We also present results for an example in which meaningful hierarchical features are extracted from a spectrogram. Such a hierarchical representation could be useful for music transcription and source separation applications. We also propose a network for language modeling.",1786,2008,,arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,17.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.4198v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.4198v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.4198v2,0807.4198v2
When is there a representer theorem? Vector versus matrix regularizers,"Andreas Argyriou, Charles Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil",3,"We consider a general class of regularization methods which learn a vector of parameters on the basis of linear measurements. It is well known that if the regularizer is a nondecreasing function of the inner product then the learned vector is a linear combination of the input data. This result, known as the {\em representer theorem}, is at the basis of kernel-based methods in machine learning. In this paper, we prove the necessity of the above condition, thereby completing the characterization of kernel methods based on regularization. We further extend our analysis to regularization methods which learn a matrix, a problem which is motivated by the application to multi-task learning. In this context, we study a more general representer theorem, which holds for a larger class of regularizers. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for these class of matrix regularizers and highlight them with some concrete examples of practical importance.

Clustered Multi-Task Learning: A Convex Formulation,"Laurent Jacob, Francis Bach, Jean-Philippe Vert",3,"In multi-task learning several related tasks are considered simultaneously, with the hope that by an appropriate sharing of information across tasks, each task may benefit from the others. In the context of learning linear functions for supervised classification or regression, this can be achieved by including a priori information about the weight vectors associated with the tasks, and how they are expected to be related to each other. In this paper, we assume that tasks are clustered into groups, which are unknown beforehand, and that tasks within a group have similar weight vectors. We design a new spectral norm that encodes this a priori assumption, without the prior knowledge of the partition of tasks into groups, resulting in a new convex optimization formulation for multi-task learning. We show in simulations on synthetic examples and on the IEDB MHC-I binding dataset, that our approach outperforms well-known convex methods for multi-task learning, as well as related non convex methods dedicated to the same problem.",1037,2008,,arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,17.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.2085v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.2085v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.2085v1,0809.2085v1

We show the surprising fact that the class-conditional independence can be used to represent the original learning task in terms of 1) learning a classifier from $\mathcal{X}_2$ to $\mathcal{X}_1$ and 2) learning the class-conditional distribution of the feature set $\mathcal{X}_1$. This fact can be exploited for semi-supervised learning because the former task can be accomplished purely from unlabeled samples.

We also show that the method always finds a kernel matrix that linearly separates the training data exactly without projecting them in infinite dimensional spaces.

"Entropy, Perception, and Relativity",Stefan Jaeger,1,"In this paper, I expand Shannon's definition of entropy into a new form of entropy that allows integration of information from different random events. Shannon's notion of entropy is a special case of my more general definition of entropy. I define probability using a so-called performance function, which is de facto an exponential distribution. Assuming that my general notion of entropy reflects the true uncertainty about a probabilistic event, I understand that our perceived uncertainty differs. I claim that our perception is the result of two opposing forces similar to the two famous antagonists in Chinese philosophy: Yin and Yang. Based on this idea, I show that our perceived uncertainty matches the true uncertainty in points determined by the golden ratio. I demonstrate that the well-known sigmoid function, which we typically employ in artificial neural networks as a non-linear threshold function, describes the actual performance. Furthermore, I provide a motivation for the time dilation in Einstein's Special Relativity, basically claiming that although time dilation conforms with our perception, it does not correspond to reality. At the end of the paper, I show how to apply this theoretical framework to practical applications. I present recognition rates for a pattern recognition problem, and also propose a network architecture that can take advantage of general entropy to solve complex decision problems.",1434,2008,,arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,17.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0139v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.0139v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0139v1,0811.0139v1
Stability Bound for Stationary Phi-mixing and Beta-mixing Processes,"Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh",2,"Most generalization bounds in learning theory are based on some measure of the complexity of the hypothesis class used, independently of any algorithm. In contrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight generalization bounds that are tailored to specific learning algorithms by exploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory, existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the samples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning applications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence.   This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a stationary phi-mixing or beta-mixing sequence, a widely adopted assumption in the study of non-i.i.d. processes that implies a dependence between observations weakening over time. We prove novel and distinct stability-based generalization bounds for stationary phi-mixing and beta-mixing sequences. These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply to all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of stability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios.   We also illustrate the application of our phi-mixing generalization bounds to general classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression, Kernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel regularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms. These novel bounds can thus be viewed as the first theoretical basis for the use of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios.",1683,2008,,arXiv Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,17.5,Machine Learning,cs.LG,https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1629v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.1629v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1629v1,0811.1629v1
Land Cover Mapping Using Ensemble Feature Selection Methods,"A. Gidudu, B. Abe, T.

Intuitively, an ensemble system should consist of base classifiers which are diverse i.e. classifiers whose decision boundaries err differently. In this paper ensemble feature selection is used to impose diversity in ensembles. The features of the constituent base classifiers for each ensemble were created through an exhaustive search algorithm using different separability indices. For each ensemble, the classification accuracy was derived as well as a diversity measure purported to give a measure of the inensemble diversity. The correlation between ensemble classification accuracy and diversity measure was determined to establish the interplay between the two variables.

BaBar - A Community Web Site in an Organizational Setting,"Ray Cowan, Yogesh Deshpande, Bebo White",3,"The BABAR Web site was established in 1993 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) to support the BABAR experiment, to report its results, and to facilitate communication among its scientific and engineering collaborators, currently numbering about 600 individuals from 75 collaborating institutions in 10 countries. The BABAR Web site is, therefore, a community Web site. At the same time it is hosted at SLAC and funded by agencies that demand adherence to policies decided under different priorities. Additionally, the BABAR Web administrators deal with the problems that arise during the course of managing users, content, policies, standards, and changing technologies. Desired solutions to some of these problems may be incompatible with the overall administration of the SLAC Web sites and/or the SLAC policies and concerns. There are thus different perspectives of the same Web site and differing expectations in segments of the SLAC population which act as constraints and challenges in any review or re-engineering activities. Web Engineering, which post-dates the BABAR Web, has aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of Web development. This paper reports on the first part of a recent review of application of Web Engineering methods to the BABAR Web site, which has led to explicit user and information models of the BABAR community and how SLAC and the BABAR community relate and react to each other.

The intelligent news foragers crawl by using the estimated long-term cumulated reward, and also have a finite sized memory: the list of most promising supplies. Foragers form an artificial life community: the most successful ones are allowed to multiply, while unsuccessful ones die out. The specific property of this community is that there is no direct communication amongst foragers but the centralized rewarding system.

Shuffling a Stacked Deck: The Case for Partially Randomized Ranking of Search Engine Results,"Sandeep Pandey, Sourashis Roy, Christopher Olston, Junghoo Cho, Soumen Chakrabarti",5,"In-degree, PageRank, number of visits and other measures of Web page popularity significantly influence the ranking of search results by modern search engines. The assumption is that popularity is closely correlated with quality, a more elusive concept that is difficult to measure directly. Unfortunately, the correlation between popularity and quality is very weak for newly-created pages that have yet to receive many visits and/or in-links. Worse, since discovery of new content is largely done by querying search engines, and because users usually focus their attention on the top few results, newly-created but high-quality pages are effectively ``shut out,'' and it can take a very long time before they become popular.   We propose a simple and elegant solution to this problem: the introduction of a controlled amount of randomness into search result ranking methods. Doing so offers new pages a chance to prove their worth, although clearly using too much randomness will degrade result quality and annul any benefits achieved. Hence there is a tradeoff between exploration to estimate the quality of new pages and exploitation of pages already known to be of high quality. We study this tradeoff both analytically and via simulation, in the context of an economic objective function based on aggregate result quality amortized over time. We show that a modest amount of randomness leads to improved search results.",1425,2005,,arXiv Information Retrieval,0,0,0,0,20.5,Information Retrieval,cs.IR,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0503011v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0503011v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0503011v1,cs/0503011v1

Fast-Forward on the Green Road to Open Access: The Case Against Mixing Up Green and Gold,Stevan Harnad,1,"This article is a critique of: ""The 'Green' and 'Gold' Roads to Open Access: The Case for Mixing and Matching"" by Jean-Claude Guedon (in Serials Review 30(4) 2004).   Open Access (OA) means: free online access to all peer-reviewed journal articles. Jean-Claude Guedon argues against the efficacy of author self-archiving of peer-reviewed journal articles (the ""Green"" road to OA). He suggests instead that we should convert to Open Access Publishing (the ""Golden"" road to OA) by ""mixing and matching"" Green and Gold as follows: o First, self-archive dissertations (not published, peer-reviewed journal articles). o Second, identify and tag how those dissertations have been evaluated and reviewed. o Third, self-archive unrefereed preprints (not published, peer-reviewed journal articles). o Fourth, develop new mechanisms for evaluating and reviewing those unrefereed preprints, at multiple levels. The result will be OA Publishing (Gold). I argue that rather than yet another 10 years of speculation like this, what is actually needed (and imminent) is for OA self-archiving to be mandated by research funders and institutions so that the self-archiving of published, peer-reviewed journal articles (Green) can be fast-forwarded to 100% OA.",1242,2005,Ariadne 42 January 2005; http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue42/harnad/,arXiv Information Retrieval,0,0,0,0,20.5,Information Retrieval,cs.IR,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0503021v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0503021v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0503021v1,cs/0503021v1

Analyse et expansion des textes en question-réponse,Bernard Jacquemin,1,"This paper presents an original methodology to consider question answering. We noticed that query expansion is often incorrect because of a bad understanding of the question. But the automatic good understanding of an utterance is linked to the context length, and the question are often short. This methodology proposes to analyse the documents and to construct an informative structure from the results of the analysis and from a semantic text expansion. The linguistic analysis identifies words (tokenization and morphological analysis), links between words (syntactic analysis) and word sense (semantic disambiguation). The text expansion adds to each word the synonyms matching its sense and replaces the words in the utterances by derivatives, modifying the syntactic schema if necessary. In this way, whatever enrichment may be, the text keeps the same meaning, but each piece of information matches many realisations. The questioning method consists in constructing a local informative structure without enrichment, and matches it with the documentary structure. If a sentence in the informative structure matches the question structure, this sentence is the answer to the question.",1190,2005,"Le poids des mots. Actes des 7es journ\'{e}es internationales

The method we propose here consists of using word sense disambiguation rules (WSD) to restrict the selection of synonyms to only these that match a specific syntactico-semantic context.

We argue that the two INEX relevance dimensions, Exhaustivity and Specificity, are not orthogonal dimensions; indeed, an empirical analysis of each dimension reveals that the grades of the two dimensions are correlated to each other. By analysing the level of agreement between the assessor and the users, we aim at identifying the best units of retrieval. The results of our analysis show that the highest level of agreement is on highly relevant and on non-relevant document components, suggesting that only the end points of the INEX 10-point relevance scale are perceived in the same way by both the assessor and the users.

Hybrid XML Retrieval: Combining Information Retrieval and a Native XML Database,"Jovan Pehcevski, James A.

For the content-only topics, we undertake a preliminary analysis of the INEX 2003 relevance assessments in order to identify the types of highly relevant document components. Further analysis identifies two complementary sub-cases of relevance assessments (""General"" and ""Specific"") and two categories of topics (""Broad"" and ""Narrow""). We develop a novel retrieval module that for a content-only topic utilises the information from the resulting answer list of a native XML database and dynamically determines the preferable units of retrieval, which we call ""Coherent Retrieval Elements"". The results of our experiments show that -- when each of the three systems is evaluated against different retrieval scenarios (such as different cases of relevance assessments, different topic categories and different choices of evaluation metrics) -- the XML retrieval systems exhibit varying behaviour and the best performance can be reached for different values of the retrieval parameters. In the case of INEX 2003 relevance assessments for the content-only topics, our newly developed hybrid XML retrieval system is substantially more effective than either Zettair or eXist, and yields a robust and a very effective XML retrieval.",1518,2005,,arXiv Information Retrieval,0,0,0,0,20.5,Information Retrieval,cs.IR,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0507070v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0507070v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0507070v1,cs/0507070v1

INEX 2003 content-and-structure topics can be classified in two categories: the first retrieving full articles as final answers, and the second retrieving more specific elements within articles as final answers. We show that for both topic categories our initial hybrid system improves the retrieval effectiveness of a native XML database. For ranking the final answer elements, we propose and evaluate a novel retrieval model that utilises the structural relationships between the answer elements of a native XML database and retrieves Coherent Retrieval Elements.

Practical Semantic Analysis of Web Sites and Documents,Thierry Despeyroux,1,"As Web sites are now ordinary products, it is necessary to explicit the notion of quality of a Web site. The quality of a site may be linked to the easiness of accessibility and also to other criteria such as the fact that the site is up to date and coherent. This last quality is difficult to insure because sites may be updated very frequently, may have many authors, may be partially generated and in this context proof-reading is very difficult. The same piece of information may be found in different occurrences, but also in data or meta-data, leading to the need for consistency checking. In this paper we make a parallel between programs and Web sites. We present some examples of semantic constraints that one would like to specify (constraints between the meaning of categories and sub-categories in a thematic directory, consistency between the organization chart and the rest of the site in an academic site). We present quickly the Natural Semantics, a way to specify the semantics of programming languages that inspires our works. Then we propose a specification language for semantic constraints in Web sites that, in conjunction with the well known ``make'' program, permits to generate some site verification tools by compiling the specification into Prolog code.

We use a flexible representation of XML documents that allows taking into account the structure only or both the structure and content. Our approach consists of representing XML documents by a set of their sub-paths, defined according to some criteria (length, root beginning, leaf ending). By considering those sub-paths as words, we can use standard methods for vocabulary reduction, and simple clustering methods such as K-means that scale well. We actually use an implementation of the clustering algorithm known as ""dynamic clouds"" that can work with distinct groups of independent variables put in separate variables. This is useful in our model since embedded sub-paths are not independent: we split potentially dependant paths into separate variables, resulting in each of them containing independant paths.

The uncovering of hidden structures by Latent Semantic Analysis,"Juan C. Valle-Lisboa, Eduardo Mizraji",2,"Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a well known method for information retrieval. It has also been applied as a model of cognitive processing and word-meaning acquisition. This dual importance of LSA derives from its capacity to modulate the meaning of words by contexts, dealing successfully with polysemy and synonymy. The underlying reasons that make the method work are not clear enough. We propose that the method works because it detects an underlying block structure (the blocks corresponding to topics) in the term by document matrix. In real cases this block structure is hidden because of perturbations. We propose that the correct explanation for LSA must be searched in the structure of singular vectors rather than in the profile of singular values. Using Perron-Frobenius theory we show that the presence of disjoint blocks of documents is marked by sign-homogeneous entries in the vectors corresponding to the documents of one block and zeros elsewhere. In the case of nearly disjoint blocks, perturbation theory shows that if the perturbations are small the zeros in the leading vectors are replaced by small numbers (pseudo-zeros). Since the singular values of each block might be very different in magnitude, their order does not mirror the order of blocks.

The role of the user within this type of system is emphasized. We propose two models which we consider important in order to adapt this system to the user. The first model is based on the definition of decisional problem and the second on the four cognitive phases of human learning. We also describe the application domain we are using to test these models in this type of system.,481,2006,Advances in Knowledge Organization 10 (2006) 247-254,arXiv Information Retrieval,0,0,0,0,19.5,Information Retrieval,cs.IR,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0608043v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0608043v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0608043v1,cs/0608043v1

Efficient access to an information in the text form is needed. Wiki resources as a modern text format provides huge number of text in a semi formalized structure. At the first stage of the methodology, documents are indexed against the ontology representing macro-situation. The indexing method uses a topic tree as a middle layer between documents and the application ontology. At the second stage documents relevant to the current situation (the abstract and operational contexts) are identified and sorted by degree of relevance. Abstract context is a problem-oriented ontology-based model. Operational context is an instantiation of the abstract context with data provided by the information sources. The following parts of the methodology are described: (i) metrics for measuring similarity of e-documents to ontology, (ii) a document index storing results of indexing of e-documents against the ontology; (iii) a method for identification of relevant e-documents based on semantic similarity measures.

Scatter Networks: A New Approach for Analyzing Information Scatter on the Web,"Lada A. Adamic, Suresh K. Bhavnani, Xiaolin Shi",3,"Information on any given topic is often scattered across the web. Previously this scatter has been characterized through the distribution of a set of facts (i.e. pieces of information) across web pages, showing that typically a few pages contain many facts on the topic, while many pages contain just a few. While such approaches have revealed important scatter phenomena, they are lossy in that they conceal how specific facts (e.g. rare facts) occur in specific types of pages (e.g. fact-rich pages). To reveal such regularities, we construct bi-partite networks, consisting of two types of vertices: the facts contained in webpages and the webpages themselves. Such a representation enables the application of a series of network analysis techniques, revealing structural features such as connectivity, robustness, and clustering. We discuss the implications of each of these features to the users' ability to find comprehensive information online. Finally, we compare the bipartite graph structure of webpages and facts with the hyperlink structure between the webpages.",1074,2006,,arXiv Information Retrieval,0,0,0,0,19.5,Information Retrieval,cs.IR,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0611131v3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0611131v3.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0611131v3,cs/0611131v3

A two-fold purpose lies behind this experiment. The first aim is to investigate the feasibility, define methods and procedures for combining two Italian lexical resources that have incompatible formats and complementary information into a Unified Lexicon (UL). The adopted strategy and the procedures appointed are described together with the driving criterion of the merging task, where a balance between human and computational efforts is pursued. The coverage of the UL has been maximized, by making use of simple and fast matching procedures. The second aim is to exploit this newly obtained resource for implementing the phonological and morphological layers of the CLIPS lexical database. Implementing these new layers and linking them with the already exisitng syntactic and semantic layers is not a trivial task.

"Tagging, Folksonomy & Co - Renaissance of Manual Indexing?",Jakob Voss,1,This paper gives an overview of current trends in manual indexing on the Web. Along with a general rise of user generated content there are more and more tagging systems that allow users to annotate digital resources with tags (keywords) and share their annotations with other users. Tagging is frequently seen in contrast to traditional knowledge organization systems or as something completely new. This paper shows that tagging should better be seen as a popular form of manual indexing on the Web. Difference between controlled and free indexing blurs with sufficient feedback mechanisms. A revised typology of tagging systems is presented that includes different user roles and knowledge organization systems with hierarchical relationships and vocabulary control.

Ontology from Local Hierarchical Structure in Text,"F. Murtagh, J. Mothe, K. Englmeier",3,"We study the notion of hierarchy in the context of visualizing textual data and navigating text collections. A formal framework for ``hierarchy'' is given by an ultrametric topology. This provides us with a theoretical foundation for concept hierarchy creation. A major objective is {\em scalable} annotation or labeling of concept maps. Serendipitously we pursue other objectives such as deriving common word pair (and triplet) phrases, i.e., word 2- and 3-grams. We evaluate our approach using (i) a collection of texts, (ii) a single text subdivided into successive parts (for which we provide an interactive demonstrator), and (iii) a text subdivided at the sentence or line level.

They provide opportunity for those who may not have the privilege to publish their thoughts through the traditional methods. They are one of the fastest growing systems of online encyclopaedia. In this study, we consider the importance of wikis as a way of creating, sharing and improving public knowledge. We identify some of the problems associated with wikis to include, (a) identification of the identities of information and its creator (b) accuracy of information (c) justification of the credibility of authors (d) vandalism of quality of information (e) weak control over the contents. A solution to some of these problems is sought through the use of an annotation model. The model assumes that contributions in wikis can be seen as annotation to the initial document. It proposed a systematic control of contributors and contributions to the initiative and the keeping of records of what existed and what was done to initial documents.

AMIEDoT: An annotation model for document tracking and recommendation service,Charles A. Robert,1,"The primary objective of document annotation in whatever form, manual or electronic is to allow those who may not have control to original document to provide personal view on information source. Beyond providing personal assessment to original information sources, we are looking at a situation where annotation made can be used as additional source of information for document tracking and recommendation service. Most of the annotation tools existing today were conceived for their independent use with no reference to the creator of the annotation. We propose AMIEDoT (Annotation Model for Information Exchange and Document Tracking) an annotation model that can assist in document tracking and recommendation service. The model is based on three parameters in the acts of annotation. We believe that introducing document parameters, time and the parameters of the creator of annotation into an annotation process can be a dependable source to know, who used a document, when a document was used and for what a document was used for. Beyond document tracking, our model can be used in not only for selective dissemination of information but for recommendation services.

Time Warp Edit Distance with Stiffness Adjustment for Time Series Matching,Pierre-François Marteau,1,"In a way similar to the string-to-string correction problem we address time series similarity in the light of a time-series-to-time-series-correction problem for which the similarity between two time series is measured as the minimum cost sequence of ""edit operations"" needed to transform one time series into another. To define the ""edit operations"" we use the paradigm of a graphical editing process and end up with a dynamic programming algorithm that we call Time Warp Edit Distance (TWED). TWED is slightly different in form from Dynamic Time Warping, Longest Common Subsequence or Edit Distance with Real Penalty algorithms. In particular, it highlights a parameter which drives a kind of stiffness of the elastic measure along the time axis. We show that the similarity provided by TWED is a metric potentially useful in time series retrieval applications since it could benefit from the triangular inequality property to speed up the retrieval process while tuning the parameters of the elastic measure. In that context, a lower bound is derived to relate the matching of time series into down sampled representation spaces to the matching into the original space. Empiric quality of the TWED distance is evaluated on a simple classification task. Compared to Edit Distance, Dynamic Time Warping, Longest Common Subsequnce and Edit Distance with Real Penalty, TWED has proven to be quite effective on the considered experimental task.",1442,2007,"IEEE Transaction on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 31,

Ontology-Supported and Ontology-Driven Conceptual Navigation on the World Wide Web,"Michel Crampes, Sylvie Ranwez",2,"This paper presents the principles of ontology-supported and ontology-driven conceptual navigation. Conceptual navigation realizes the independence between resources and links to facilitate interoperability and reusability. An engine builds dynamic links, assembles resources under an argumentative scheme and allows optimization with a possible constraint, such as the user's available time. Among several strategies, two are discussed in detail with examples of applications. On the one hand, conceptual specifications for linking and assembling are embedded in the resource meta-description with the support of the ontology of the domain to facilitate meta-communication. Resources are like agents looking for conceptual acquaintances with intention. On the other hand, the domain ontology and an argumentative ontology drive the linking and assembling strategies.",867,2007,Proceedings Hypertext 2000 (2000) 80,arXiv Information Retrieval,0,0,0,0,18.5,Information Retrieval,cs.IR,https://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1886v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.1886v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1886v1,0705.1886v1

These web sites consisted of as little as a few thousand pages to millions of pages. Statistical analysis of these 18 sites revealed that the internal link structure of the web sites are significantly different when measured with first and second-order topological properties, i.e. properties based on the connectivity of an individual or a pairs of nodes. However, examination of a third-order topological property that consider the connectivity between three nodes that form a triangle, revealed a strong correspondence across web sites, suggestive of an invariant.

The difficulty which arises is no longer the existence of information but rather the access to this information. When designing multimedia information retrieval system, it is appropriate to bear in mind the potential users and their information needs. We assumed that multimedia information representation which takes into account explicitly the users' needs and the cases of use could contribute to the adaptation potentials of the system for the end-users. We believe also that responses of multimedia information system would be more relevant to the users' needs if the types of results to be used from the system were identified before the design and development of the system. We propose the integration of the users' information needs. More precisely integrating usage contexts of resulting information in an information system (during creation and feedback) should enhance more pertinent users' need.

Website Optimization through Mining User Navigational Pattern,Biswajit Biswal,1,"With the World Wide Web's ubiquity increase and the rapid development of various online businesses, the complexity of web sites grow. The analysis of web user's navigational pattern within a web site can provide useful information for server performance enhancements, restructuring a website and direct marketing in e-commerce etc. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed for mining such navigation patterns.

Comparing and Combining Methods for Automatic Query Expansion,"José R.

In this work we have tested different approaches to extract the candidate query terms from the top ranked documents returned by the first-pass retrieval.   One of them is the cooccurrence approach, based on measures of cooccurrence of the candidate and the query terms in the retrieved documents. The other one, the probabilistic approach, is based on the probability distribution of terms in the collection and in the top ranked set.   We compare the retrieval improvement achieved by expanding the query with terms obtained with different methods belonging to both approaches. Besides, we have developed a na\""ive combination of both kinds of method, with which we have obtained results that improve those obtained with any of them separately.

In this paper we analyze the online computation of rankings of users associated to facets made up of multiple tags. Possible applications are user reputation evaluation (ego-ranking) and improvement of content quality in case of retrieval. We propose a solution based on PageRank as centrality measure: (i) a ranking for each tag is computed offline on the basis of the corresponding tag-dependent subgraph; (ii) a faceted order is generated by merging rankings corresponding to all the tags in the facet. The fundamental assumption, validated by empirical observations, is that step (i) is scalable.

Introduction to Searching with Regular Expressions,Christopher M. Frenz,1,"The explosive rate of information growth and availability often makes it increasingly difficult to locate information pertinent to your needs. These problems are often compounded when keyword based search methodologies are not adequate for describing the information you seek. In many instances, information such as Web site URLs, phone numbers, etc. can often be better identified through the use of a textual pattern than by keyword. For example, many more phone numbers could be picked up by a search for the pattern (XXX) XXX-XXXX, where X could be any digit, than would be by a search for any specific phone number (i.e. the keyword approach). Programming languages typically allow for the matching of textual patterns via the usage of regular expressions. This tutorial will provide an introduction to the basics of programming regular expressions as well as provide an introduction to how regular expressions can be applied to data processing tasks such as information extraction and search refinement.",1009,2008,,arXiv Information Retrieval,0,0,0,0,17.5,Information Retrieval,cs.IR,https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1732v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.1732v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1732v1,0810.1732v1

A simplified version of this formal model is implemented to carry out textual documents classification experiments. First results show, for a adhoc weighting strategy, that the structural context of word occurrences has a significant impact on classification results comparing to the performance of a simple multinomial naive Bayes classifier.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for automatically extracting web page snippets that are highly relevant to the query intention and expressive of the pages' entire content. We show that the usage of semantics, as a basis for focused retrieval, produces high quality text snippet suggestions. The snippets delivered by our method are significantly better in terms of retrieval performance compared to those derived using the pages' statistical content. Furthermore, our study suggests that semantically-driven snippet generation can also be used to augment traditional passage retrieval algorithms based on word overlap or statistical weights, since they typically differ in coverage and produce different results.

Macrodynamics of users' behavior in Information Retrieval,"Daniel Sonntag, Romàn R. Zapatrin",2,"We present a method to geometrize massive data sets from search engines query logs. For this purpose, a macrodynamic-like quantitative model of the Information Retrieval (IR) process is developed, whose paradigm is inspired by basic constructions of Einstein's general relativity theory in which all IR objects are uniformly placed in a common Room. The Room has a structure similar to Einsteinian spacetime, namely that of a smooth manifold. Documents and queries are treated as matter objects and sources of material fields. Relevance, the central notion of IR, becomes a dynamical issue controlled by both gravitation (or, more precisely, as the motion in a curved spacetime) and forces originating from the interactions of matter fields. The spatio-temporal description ascribes dynamics to any document or query, thus providing a uniform description for documents of both initially static and dynamical nature. Within the IR context, the techniques presented are based on two ideas. The first is the placement of all objects participating in IR into a common continuous space. The second idea is the `objectivization' of the IR process; instead of expressing users' wishes, we consider the overall IR as an objective physical process, representing the IR process in terms of motion in a given external-fields configuration.

Role of Weak Ties in Link Prediction of Complex Networks,"Linyuan Lu, Tao Zhou",2,"Plenty of algorithms for link prediction have been proposed and were applied to various real networks.

In this paper, we use local similarity indices to estimate the likelihood of the existence of links in weighted networks, including Common Neighbor, Adamic-Adar Index, Resource Allocation Index, and their weighted versions. In both the unweighted and weighted cases, the resource allocation index performs the best. To our surprise, the weighted indices perform worse, which reminds us of the well-known Weak Tie Theory. Further extensive experimental study shows that the weak ties play a significant role in the link prediction problem, and to emphasize the contribution of weak ties can remarkably enhance the predicting accuracy.",807,2009,,arXiv Information Retrieval,0,0,0,0,16.5,Information Retrieval,cs.IR,https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.1728v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.1728v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.1728v2,0907.1728v2
Related terms search based on WordNet / Wiktionary and its application in Ontology Matching,"A. A.

Metrics are estimated using the test collection, containing 353 English word pairs with a relatedness score assigned by human evaluators. The experiment shows that the proposed method is capable in principle of calculating a semantic distance between pair of words in any language presented in Russian Wiktionary.

Effective Personalized Recommendation in Collaborative Tagging Systems,"Zi-Ke Zhang, Tao Zhou",2,"Recently, collaborative tagging systems have attracted more and more attention and have been widely applied in web systems.

USUM: Update Summary Generation System,"C Ravindranath Chowdary, P Sreenivasa Kumar",2,"Huge amount of information is present in the World Wide Web and a large amount is being added to it frequently. A query-specific summary of multiple documents is very helpful to the user in this context. Currently, few systems have been proposed for query-specific, extractive multi-document summarization. If a summary is available for a set of documents on a given query and if a new document is added to the corpus, generating an updated summary from the scratch is time consuming and many a times it is not practical/possible. In this paper we propose a solution to this problem. This is especially useful in a scenario where the source documents are not accessible. We cleverly embed the sentences of the current summary into the new document and then perform query-specific summary generation on that document.

Evaluation of Coordination Techniques in Synchronous Collaborative Information Retrieval,"Colum Foley, Alan F. Smeaton",2,"Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) research has focussed on a single user interaction modality, where a user searches to satisfy an information need. Recent advances in web technologies and computer hardware have enabled multiple users to collaborate on many computer-supported tasks, therefore there is an increasing opportunity to support two or more users searching together at the same time in order to satisfy a shared information need, which we refer to as Synchronous Collaborative Information Retrieval (SCIR). SCIR systems represent a significant paradigmatic shift from traditional IR systems. In order to support effective SCIR, new techniques are required to coordinate users' activities. In addition, the novel domain of SCIR presents challenges for effective evaluations of these systems. In this paper we will propose an effective and re-usable evaluation methodology based on simulating users searching together. We will outline how we have used this evaluation in empirical studies of the effects of different division of labour and sharing of knowledge techniques for SCIR.",1095,2009,,arXiv Information Retrieval,0,0,0,0,16.5,Information Retrieval,cs.IR,https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0912v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0912v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0912v1,0908.0912v1

A Method for Accelerating the HITS Algorithm,"Andri Mirzal, Masashi Furukawa",2,"We present a new method to accelerate the HITS algorithm by exploiting hyperlink structure of the web graph. The proposed algorithm extends the idea of authority and hub scores from HITS by introducing two diagonal matrices which contain constants that act as weights to make authority pages more authoritative and hub pages more hubby. This method works because in the web graph good authorities are pointed to by good hubs and good hubs point to good authorities. Consequently, these pages will collect their scores faster under the proposed algorithm than under the standard HITS. We show that the authority and hub vectors of the proposed algorithm exist but are not necessarily be unique, and then give a treatment to ensure the uniqueness property of the vectors.

Weblog Clustering in Multilinear Algebra Perspective,Andri Mirzal,1,"This paper describes a clustering method to group the most similar and important weblogs with their descriptive shared words by using a technique from multilinear algebra known as PARAFAC tensor decomposition. The proposed method first creates labeled-link network representation of the weblog datasets, where the nodes are the blogs and the labels are the shared words. Then, 3-way adjacency tensor is extracted from the network and the PARAFAC decomposition is applied to the tensor to get pairs of node lists and label lists with scores attached to each list as the indication of the degree of importance. The clustering is done by sorting the lists in decreasing order and taking the pairs of top ranked blogs and words. Thus, unlike standard co-clustering methods, this method not only groups the similar blogs with their descriptive words but also tends to produce clusters of important blogs and descriptive words.",921,2009,"International Journal of Information Technology, Vol. 15 No. 1,

However, the IRS shows certain differences between user relevance and system relevance. These gaps are essentially related to the imperfection of the indexing process (as approach related to the IR), to problems related to the misunderstanding of the natural language and the non correspondence between the real needs of the user and the results of his query. As idea is to think about an ?intellectual? indexing that takes into account the point of view of the user. By consulting the document, user can build information as added-value on the existing content: new information which grows contents and allows the semantic visibility or facilitates the reading by the annotations, by links to other content, by new descriptors, specific new abstracts of users: it is the reindexing of the contents by the contribution or the vote of the uses",973,2009,"conf\'erence internationale sur les Syst\`emes d'information et

The steps used are: (i) Depending on the system, the ANN-architecture and the input & output parameters are decided, (ii) Training & test data are generated from simplified circuits and through tactic-superposition of it for complex circuits, (iii) Training the ANN with training data through many cycles and (iv) Test-data are used for predicting the response-function results. It is found that the proposed novel method for response prediction works satisfactorily. Thus this method could be used specially for complex systems where other methods are unable to tackle it.

On Interference of Signals and Generalization in Feedforward Neural Networks,Artur Rataj,1,This paper studies how the generalization ability of neurons can be affected by mutual processing of different signals. This study is done on the basis of a feedforward artificial neural network. The mutual processing of signals can possibly be a good model of patterns in a set generalized by a neural network and in effect may improve generalization.

Then, if the computational complexity of a propagation through a single such a weight function would be kept low, then the introduced neural networks might possibly be relatively fast.

The former adopts qubit chromosomes as representations and employs quantum gates for the search of the best solution. The later tries to solve a key question in this field: what GAs will look like as an implementation on quantum hardware? As we shall see, there is not a complete answer for this question.

Efficiency Enhancement of Probabilistic Model Building Genetic Algorithms,"Kumara Sastry, David E.

The first technique proposes the use of a mutation operator which performs local search in the sub-solution neighborhood identified through the probabilistic model.

The fitness values of some offspring are estimated using the probabilistic model, thereby avoiding computationally expensive function evaluations. The scalability of the aforementioned techniques are analyzed using facetwise models for convergence time and population sizing. The speed-up obtained by each of the methods is predicted and verified with empirical results.

Satellite constellations, particularly LEO satellite constellations have become a reality in operational to have a non-breaking voice/data communication around the world.Routing in these constellations has to be treated in a non conventional way, taking their network geometry into consideration. One of the efficient methods of optimization is putting Neural Networks to use.

Does a Plane Imitate a Bird? Does Computer Vision Have to Follow Biological Paradigms?,Emanuel Diamant,1,"We posit a new paradigm for image information processing. For the last 25 years, this task was usually approached in the frame of Treisman's two-stage paradigm [1]. The latter supposes an unsupervised, bottom-up directed process of preliminary information pieces gathering at the lower processing stages and a supervised, top-down directed process of information pieces binding and grouping at the higher stages. It is acknowledged that these sub-processes interact and intervene between them in a tricky and a complicated manner. Notwithstanding the prevalence of this paradigm in biological and computer vision, we nevertheless propose to replace it with a new one, which we would like to designate as a two-part paradigm. In it, information contained in an image is initially extracted in an independent top-down manner by one part of the system, and then it is examined and interpreted by another, separate system part. We argue that the new paradigm seems to be more plausible than its forerunner.

On the utility of the multimodal problem generator for assessing the performance of Evolutionary Algorithms,"Fernando G. Lobo, Claudio F.

It is also shown a close relationship between the supply and decision making issues that have been identified previously in the context of population sizing models for additively decomposable problems.   The most important result of the paper, however, is that solving an instance of the multimodal problem generator is like solving a peak-in-a-haystack, and it is argued that evolutionary algorithms are not the best algorithms for such a task. Finally, and as opposed to what several researchers have been doing, it is our strong belief that the multimodal problem generator is not adequate for assessing the performance of evolutionary algorithms.",963,2006,,arXiv Neural and Evolutionary Computing,0,0,0,0,19.5,Neural and Evolutionary Computing,cs.NE,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0602051v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0602051v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0602051v1,cs/0602051v1

This paper revisits the latter topic and pays special attention to the genetic algorithm with adaptive population size (APGA), for which several researchers have claimed to be very effective at autonomously (re)sizing the population.   As opposed to those previous claims, this paper suggests a complete opposite view. Specifically, it shows that APGA is not capable of adapting the population size at all.

Two ways of combining learning and genetic search are explored: one exploits the Baldwin effect, while the other uses a Lamarckian strategy. Our experiments show that using a Lamarckian op- erator makes the algorithm find networks with a low error rate, and the smallest size, while using the Bald- win effect obtains MLPs with the smallest error rate, and a larger size, taking longer to reach a solution.

Theoretical Properties of Projection Based Multilayer Perceptrons with Functional Inputs,"Fabrice Rossi, Brieuc Conan-Guez",2,"Many real world data are sampled functions. As shown by Functional Data Analysis (FDA) methods, spectra, time series, images, gesture recognition data, etc. can be processed more efficiently if their functional nature is taken into account during the data analysis process. This is done by extending standard data analysis methods so that they can apply to functional inputs. A general way to achieve this goal is to compute projections of the functional data onto a finite dimensional sub-space of the functional space. The coordinates of the data on a basis of this sub-space provide standard vector representations of the functions. The obtained vectors can be processed by any standard method. In our previous work, this general approach has been used to define projection based Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with functional inputs. We study in this paper important theoretical properties of the proposed model. We show in particular that MLPs with functional inputs are universal approximators: they can approximate to arbitrary accuracy any continuous mapping from a compact sub-space of a functional space to R. Moreover, we provide a consistency result that shows that any mapping from a functional space to R can be learned thanks to examples by a projection based MLP: the generalization mean square error of the MLP decreases to the smallest possible mean square error on the data when the number of examples goes to infinity.",1437,2006,,arXiv Neural and Evolutionary Computing,0,0,0,0,19.5,Neural and Evolutionary Computing,cs.NE,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0604001v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0604001v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0604001v1,cs/0604001v1

Risk Assessment Algorithms Based On Recursive Neural Networks,"Alejandro Chinea Manrique De Lara, Michel Parent",2,"The assessment of highly-risky situations at road intersections have been recently revealed as an important research topic within the context of the automotive industry. In this paper we shall introduce a novel approach to compute risk functions by using a combination of a highly non-linear processing model in conjunction with a powerful information encoding procedure. Specifically, the elements of information either static or dynamic that appear in a road intersection scene are encoded by using directed positional acyclic labeled graphs. The risk assessment problem is then reformulated in terms of an inductive learning task carried out by a recursive neural network. Recursive neural networks are connectionist models capable of solving supervised and non-supervised learning problems represented by directed ordered acyclic graphs. The potential of this novel approach is demonstrated through well predefined scenarios. The major difference of our approach compared to others is expressed by the fact of learning the structure of the risk. Furthermore, the combination of a rich information encoding procedure with a generalized model of dynamical recurrent networks permit us, as we shall demonstrate, a sophisticated processing of information that we believe as being a first step for building future advanced intersection safety systems",1349,2007,"Dans International Joint Conference On Neural Networks - IJCNN

So these landscapes offer a scale of continuity from Royal Road functions, with neutrality and no epistasis, to landscapes with a large amount of epistasis and no redundancy. To gain insight into these fitness landscapes, we first use standard tools such as adaptive walks and correlation length.

Optimization of supply diversity for the self-assembly of simple objects in two and three dimensions,"Fabio R. J. Vieira, Valmir C. Barbosa",2,"The field of algorithmic self-assembly is concerned with the design and analysis of self-assembly systems from a computational perspective, that is, from the perspective of mathematical problems whose study may give insight into the natural processes through which elementary objects self-assemble into more complex ones. One of the main problems of algorithmic self-assembly is the minimum tile set problem (MTSP), which asks for a collection of types of elementary objects (called tiles) to be found for the self-assembly of an object having a pre-established shape. Such a collection is to be as concise as possible, thus minimizing supply diversity, while satisfying a set of stringent constraints having to do with the termination and other properties of the self-assembly process from its tile types. We present a study of what we think is the first practical approach to MTSP. Our study starts with the introduction of an evolutionary heuristic to tackle MTSP and includes results from extensive experimentation with the heuristic on the self-assembly of simple objects in two and three dimensions. The heuristic we introduce combines classic elements from the field of evolutionary computation with a problem-specific variant of Pareto dominance into a multi-objective approach to MTSP.",1294,2007,"Natural Computing 10 (2011), 551-581",arXiv Neural and Evolutionary Computing,0,0,0,0,18.5,Neural and Evolutionary Computing,cs.NE,https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.0672v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.0672v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.0672v2,0710.0672v2

Such a window can be used either to ask for one of the well known ready-to-use algorithms, or to very easily explore new combinations that have not yet been studied.

Digital Ecosystems: Stability of Evolving Agent Populations,"P. De Wilde, G.

Engineered systems are becoming ever more complex, approaching the same levels of biological ecosystems, and so their stability becomes ever more important, but taking on more and more differential dynamics can make stability an ever more elusive property. The Chli-DeWilde definition of stability views a Multi-Agent System as a discrete time Markov chain with potentially unknown transition probabilities. With a Multi-Agent System being considered stable when its state, a stochastic process, has converged to an equilibrium distribution, because stability of a system can be understood intuitively as exhibiting bounded behaviour. We investigate an extension to include Multi-Agent Systems with evolutionary dynamics, focusing on the evolving agent populations of our Digital Ecosystem. We then built upon this to construct an entropy-based definition for the degree of instability (entropy of the limit probabilities), which was later used to perform a stability analysis.

Digital Ecosystems are a novel optimisation technique where the optimisation works at two levels: a first optimisation, migration of agents (representing services) which are distributed in a decentralised peer-to-peer network, operating continuously in time; this process feeds a second optimisation based on evolutionary computing that operates locally on single peers and is aimed at finding solutions to satisfy locally relevant constraints. We created an Ecosystem-Oriented Architecture of Digital Ecosystems by extending Service-Oriented Architectures with distributed evolutionary computing, allowing services to recombine and evolve over time, constantly seeking to improve their effectiveness for the user base. Individuals within our Digital Ecosystem will be applications (groups of services), created in response to user requests by using evolutionary optimisation to aggregate the services. These individuals will migrate through the Digital Ecosystem and adapt to find niches where they are useful in fulfilling other user requests for applications.

In addition to accurate predictions, it is often needed to extract information about which wavelengths in the spectra contribute in an effective way to the quality of the prediction. This implies to select wavelengths (or wavelength intervals), a problem associated to variable selection. In this paper, it is shown how this problem may be tackled in the specific case of smooth (for example infrared) spectra. The functional character of the spectra (their smoothness) is taken into account through a functional variable projection procedure. Contrarily to standard approaches, the projection is performed on a basis that is driven by the spectra themselves, in order to best fit their characteristics.

The representation must at least be able to encode all possible solutions of an optimization problem, and genetic operators such as crossover and mutation should be applicable to it. In this paper, serial alternation strategies between two codings are formulated in the framework of dynamic change of genotype encoding in GAs for function optimization.

Additionally, we suggest polished formulae for the learning rate of the covariance matrix and the recombination weights. In contrast to cumulative step-size adaptation or to the 1/5-th success rule, the refined two-point adaptation (TPA) does not rely on any internal model of optimality. In contrast to conventional self-adaptation, the TPA will achieve a better target step-size in particular with large populations. The disadvantage of TPA is that it relies on two additional objective function",627,2008,,arXiv Neural and Evolutionary Computing,0,0,0,0,17.5,Neural and Evolutionary Computing,cs.NE,https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0231v4,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.0231v4.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0231v4,0805.0231v4
Stochastic Optimization Approaches for Solving Sudoku,"Meir Perez, Tshilidzi Marwala",2,"In this paper the Sudoku problem is solved using stochastic search techniques and these are: Cultural Genetic Algorithm (CGA), Repulsive Particle Swarm Optimization (RPSO), Quantum Simulated Annealing (QSA) and the Hybrid method that combines Genetic Algorithm with Simulated Annealing (HGASA). The results obtained show that the CGA, QSA and HGASA are able to solve the Sudoku puzzle with CGA finding a solution in 28 seconds, while QSA finding a solution in 65 seconds and HGASA in 1.447 seconds.

Neural network learning of optimal Kalman prediction and control,Ralph Linsker,1,"Although there are many neural network (NN) algorithms for prediction and for control, and although methods for optimal estimation (including filtering and prediction) and for optimal control in linear systems were provided by Kalman in 1960 (with nonlinear extensions since then), there has been, to my knowledge, no NN algorithm that learns either Kalman prediction or Kalman control (apart from the special case of stationary control). Here we show how optimal Kalman prediction and control (KPC), as well as system identification, can be learned and executed by a recurrent neural network composed of linear-response nodes, using as input only a stream of noisy measurement data.   The requirements of KPC appear to impose significant constraints on the allowed NN circuitry and signal flows. The NN architecture implied by these constraints bears certain resemblances to the local-circuit architecture of mammalian cerebral cortex. We discuss these resemblances, as well as caveats that limit our current ability to draw inferences for biological function. It has been suggested that the local cortical circuit (LCC) architecture may perform core functions (as yet unknown) that underlie sensory, motor,and other cortical processing. It is reasonable to conjecture that such functions may include prediction, the estimation or inference of missing or noisy sensory data, and the goal-driven generation of control signals. The resemblances found between the KPC NN architecture and that of the LCC are consistent with this conjecture.",1538,2008,,arXiv Neural and Evolutionary Computing,0,0,0,0,17.5,Neural and Evolutionary Computing,cs.NE,https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.4247v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.4247v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.4247v1,0805.4247v1
Structural Damage Detection Using Randomized Trained Neural Networks,"Ismoyo Haryanto, Joga Dharma Setiawan, Agus Budiyono",3,"A computationally method on damage detection problems in structures was conducted using neural networks. The problem that is considered in this works consists of estimating the existence, location and extent of stiffness reduction in structure which is indicated by the changes of the structural static parameters such as deflection and strain. The neural network was trained to recognize the behaviour of static parameter of the undamaged structure as well as of the structure with various possible damage extent and location which were modelled as random states. The proposed techniques were applied to detect damage in a simply supported beam. The structure was analyzed using finite-element-method (FEM) and the damage identification was conducted by a back-propagation neural network using the change of the structural strain and displacement.

The Fundamental Problem with the Building Block Hypothesis,Keki Burjorjee,1,"Skepticism of the building block hypothesis (BBH) has previously been expressed on account of the weak theoretical foundations of this hypothesis and the anomalies in the empirical record of the simple genetic algorithm. In this paper we hone in on a more fundamental cause for skepticism--the extraordinary strength of some of the assumptions that undergird the BBH. Specifically, we focus on assumptions made about the distribution of fitness over the genome set, and argue that these assumptions are unacceptably strong. As most of these assumptions have been embraced by the designers of so-called ""competent"" genetic algorithms, our critique is relevant to an appraisal of such algorithms as well.",702,2008,,arXiv Neural and Evolutionary Computing,0,0,0,0,17.5,Neural and Evolutionary Computing,cs.NE,https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3356v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.3356v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3356v1,0810.3356v1
Two Remarkable Computational Competencies of the Simple Genetic Algorithm,Keki M. Burjorjee,1,"Since the inception of genetic algorithmics the identification of computational efficiencies of the simple genetic algorithm (SGA) has been an important goal. In this paper we distinguish between a computational competency of the SGA--an efficient, but narrow computational ability--and a computational proficiency of the SGA--a computational ability that is both efficient and broad. Till date, attempts to deduce a computational proficiency of the SGA have been unsuccessful. It may, however, be possible to inductively infer a computational proficiency of the SGA from a set of related computational competencies that have been deduced. With this in mind we deduce two computational competencies of the SGA. These competencies, when considered together, point toward a remarkable computational proficiency of the SGA.

Besides giving the best known approximation ratio in terms of n, this marks the first non-trivial approximation result as a function of the maximum degree Delta. This result can be generalized to k-colorable graphs to obtain a coloring using min O(Delta^{1-2/k} log^{1/2} Delta log n), O(n^{1-3/(k+1)} log^{1/2} n) colors.

Our analysis predicts an ``easy-hard-easy'' pattern in this latter case. Under a rescaled parameter, the graphs of satisfaction probability corresponding to finite values of k converge to the one for the uniform case, a ``dimension-dependent behavior'' similar to the one found experimentally by Kirkpatrick and Selman (Science'94) for k-SAT.

The first algorithm solves the APSP problem for weighted directed graphs in which the edge weights are integers of small absolute value in $\Ot(n^{2+\mu})$ time, where $\mu$ satisfies the equation $\omega(1,\mu,1)=1+2\mu$ and $\omega(1,\mu,1)$ is the exponent of the multiplication of an $n\times n^\mu$ matrix by an $n^\mu \times n$ matrix. Currently, the best available bounds on $\omega(1,\mu,1)$, obtained by Coppersmith, imply that $\mu<0.575$. The running time of our algorithm is therefore $O(n^{2.575})$. Our algorithm improves on the $\Ot(n^{(3+\omega)/2})$ time algorithm, where $\omega=\omega(1,1,1)<2.376$ is the usual exponent of matrix multiplication, obtained by Alon, Galil and Margalit, whose running time is only known to be $O(n^{2.688})$.   The second algorithm solves the APSP problem {\em almost} exactly for directed graphs with {\em arbitrary} non-negative real weights. The algorithm runs in $\Ot((n^\omega/\eps)\log (W/\eps))$ time, where $\eps>0$ is an error parameter and W is the largest edge weight in the graph, after the edge weights are scaled so that the smallest non-zero edge weight in the graph is 1. It returns estimates of all the distances in the graph with a stretch of at most $1+\eps$. Corresponding paths can also be found efficiently.",1462,2000,,arXiv Data Structures and Algorithms,0,0,0,0,25.5,Data Structures and Algorithms,cs.DS,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0008011v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0008011v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0008011v1,cs/0008011v1

Dancing links,Donald E. Knuth,1,"The author presents two tricks to accelerate depth-first search algorithms for a class of combinatorial puzzle problems, such as tiling a tray by a fixed set of polyominoes. The first trick is to implement each assumption of the search with reversible local operations on doubly linked lists. By this trick, every step of the search affects the data incrementally.   The second trick is to add a ghost square that represents the identity of each polyomino. Thus puts the rule that each polyomino be used once on the same footing as the rule that each square be covered once. The coding simplifies to a more abstract form which is equivalent to 0-1 integer programming. More significantly for the total computation time, the search can naturally switch between placing a fixed polyomino or covering a fixed square at different stages, according to a combined heuristic.   Finally the author reports excellent performance for his algorithm for some familiar puzzles. These include tiling a hexagon by 19 hexiamonds and the N queens problem for N up to 18.",1053,2000,"Millenial Perspectives in Computer Science, 2000, 187--214",arXiv Data Structures and Algorithms,0,0,0,0,25.5,Data Structures and Algorithms,cs.DS,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0011047v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0011047v1,cs/0011047v1

Adaptive sorting algorithms utilize the presortedness present in a given sequence. We have probabilistically increased the amount of presortedness present in a sequence by using a random shuffling technique that requires little computation. Theoretical analysis suggests that the proposed scheme can improve the performance of adaptive sorting. Experimental results show that it significantly reduces the amount of disorder present in a given sequence and improves the execution time of adaptive sorting algorithm as well.,616,2000,,arXiv Data Structures and Algorithms,0,0,0,0,25.5,Data Structures and Algorithms,cs.DS,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0012002v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0012002v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0012002v1,cs/0012002v1

Faster Algorithm of String Comparison,"Qi Xiao Yang, Sung Sam Yuan, Lu Chun, Li Zhao, Sun Peng",5,"In many applications, it is necessary to determine the string similarity. Edit distance[WF74] approach is a classic method to determine Field Similarity. A well known dynamic programming algorithm [GUS97] is used to calculate edit distance with the time complexity O(nm). (for worst case, average case and even best case) Instead of continuing with improving the edit distance approach, [LL+99] adopted a brand new approach-token-based approach. Its new concept of token-base-retain the original semantic information, good time complex-O(nm) (for worst, average and best case) and good experimental performance make it a milestone paper in this area. Further study indicates that there is still room for improvement of its Field Similarity algorithm. Our paper is to introduce a package of substring-based new algorithms to determine Field Similarity. Combined together, our new algorithms not only achieve higher accuracy but also gain the time complexity O(knm) (k<0.75) for worst case, O(*n) where <6 for average case and O(1) for best case.

Improving Table Compression with Combinatorial Optimization,"Adam L. Buchsbaum, Glenn S. Fowler, Raffaele Giancarlo",3,"We study the problem of compressing massive tables within the partition-training paradigm introduced by Buchsbaum et al. [SODA'00], in which a table is partitioned by an off-line training procedure into disjoint intervals of columns, each of which is compressed separately by a standard, on-line compressor like gzip. We provide a new theory that unifies previous experimental observations on partitioning and heuristic observations on column permutation, all of which are used to improve compression rates. Based on the theory, we devise the first on-line training algorithms for table compression, which can be applied to individual files, not just continuously operating sources; and also a new, off-line training algorithm, based on a link to the asymmetric traveling salesman problem, which improves on prior work by rearranging columns prior to partitioning. We demonstrate these results experimentally. On various test files, the on-line algorithms provide 35-55% improvement over gzip with negligible slowdown; the off-line reordering provides up to 20% further improvement over partitioning alone. We also show that a variation of the table compression problem is MAX-SNP hard.",1186,2002,"JACM 50(6):825-851, 2003",arXiv Data Structures and Algorithms,0,0,0,0,23.5,Data Structures and Algorithms,cs.DS,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0203018v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0203018v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0203018v1,cs/0203018v1

This leads to an optimal bound of O(sqrt(log n/loglog n)) for searching and updating a dynamic set of n integer keys in linear space. Here searching an integer y means finding the maximum key in the set which is smaller than or equal to y. This problem is equivalent to the standard text book problem of maintaining an ordered set (see, e.g., Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein: Introduction to Algorithms, 2nd ed., MIT Press, 2001).   The best previous deterministic linear space bound was O(log n/loglog n) due Fredman and Willard from STOC 1990. No better deterministic search bound was known using polynomial space.   We also get the following worst-case linear space trade-offs between the number n, the word length w, and the maximal key U < 2^w: O(min{loglog n+log n/log w, (loglog n)(loglog U)/(logloglog U)}).

It performs remarkably well from an average case point of view: For any discrete distribution in which the optimal expected waste is sublinear, $SS$ also has sublinear expected waste. For any discrete distribution where the optimal expected waste is bounded, $SS$ has expected waste at most $O(\log n)$. In addition, we discuss several interesting variants on $SS$, including a randomized $O(nB\log B)$-time on-line algorithm $SS^*$, based on $SS$, whose expected behavior is essentially optimal for all discrete distributions.

We present faster but approximate algorithms for the same problem; the fastest such algorithm runs in linear time and produces a solution that is within an additive constant of optimal.   In addition, we show how to extend any approximately optimal algorithm to the cache-oblivious setting in which the block-transfer size is unknown to the algorithm. The query performance of the cache-oblivious layout is within a constant factor of the query performance of the optimal known-block-size layout. Computing the cache-oblivious layout requires only logarithmically many calls to the layout algorithm for known block size; in particular, the cache-oblivious layout can be computed in O(N lg N) time, where N is the number of nodes.

Compact Approximation of Lattice Functions with Applications to Large-Alphabet Text Search,"Paolo Boldi, Sebastiano Vigna",2,"We propose a very simple randomised data structure that stores an approximation from above of a lattice-valued function.

The structure is particularly well suited for functions that are bottom on most of their domain. We then show how to use our methods to store in a compact way the bad-character shift function for variants of the Boyer-Moore text search algorithms. As a result, we obtain practical implementations of these algorithms that can be used with large alphabets, such as Unicode collation elements, with a small setup time.

Efficient pebbling for list traversal synopses,"Yossi Matias, Ely Porat",2,"We show how to support efficient back traversal in a unidirectional list, using small memory and with essentially no slowdown in forward steps. Using $O(\log n)$ memory for a list of size $n$, the $i$'th back-step from the farthest point reached so far takes $O(\log i)$ time in the worst case, while the overhead per forward step is at most $\epsilon$ for arbitrary small constant $\epsilon>0$. An arbitrary sequence of forward and back steps is allowed. A full trade-off between memory usage and time per back-step is presented: $k$ vs. $kn^{1/k}$ and vice versa. Our algorithms are based on a novel pebbling technique which moves pebbles on a virtual binary, or $t$-ary, tree that can only be traversed in a pre-order fashion. The compact data structures used by the pebbling algorithms, called list traversal synopses, extend to general directed graphs, and have other interesting applications, including memory efficient hash-chain implementation. Perhaps the most surprising application is in showing that for any program, arbitrary rollback steps can be efficiently supported with small overhead in memory, and marginal overhead in its ordinary execution. More concretely: Let $P$ be a program that runs for at most $T$ steps, using memory of size $M$. Then, at the cost of recording the input used by the program, and increasing the memory by a factor of $O(\log T)$ to $O(M \log T)$, the program $P$ can be extended to support an arbitrary sequence of forward execution and rollback steps: the $i$'th rollback step takes $O(\log i)$ time in the worst case, while forward steps take O(1) time in the worst case, and $1+\epsilon$ amortized time per step.",1661,2003,,arXiv Data Structures and Algorithms,0,0,0,0,22.5,Data Structures and Algorithms,cs.DS,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0306104v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0306104v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0306104v1,cs/0306104v1

For the case that $|A|=|B|$ the number of edges is $n^2$ and therefore the complexity is $O(n^3)$.

We present an extension of this lemma, which works well when the event to be shown to exist is a conjunction of individual events, each of which asserts that a random variable does not deviate much from its mean. As applications, we consider two classes of NP-hard integer programs: minimax and covering integer programs. A key technique, randomized rounding of linear relaxations, was developed by Raghavan and Thompson to derive good approximation algorithms for such problems. We use our extension of the Local Lemma to prove that randomized rounding produces, with non-zero probability, much better feasible solutions than known before, if the constraint matrices of these integer programs are column-sparse (e.g., routing using short paths, problems on hypergraphs with small dimension/degree). This complements certain well-known results from discrepancy theory.

Static Data Structure for Discrete Advance Bandwidth Reservations on the Internet,"Andrej Brodnik, Andreas Nilsson",2,"In this paper we present a discrete data structure for reservations of limited resources. A reservation is defined as a tuple consisting of the time interval of when the resource should be reserved, $I_R$, and the amount of the resource that is reserved, $B_R$, formally $R=\{I_R,B_R\}$.   The data structure is similar to a segment tree. The maximum spanning interval of the data structure is fixed and defined in advance. The granularity and thereby the size of the intervals of the leaves is also defined in advance. The data structure is built only once. Neither nodes nor leaves are ever inserted, deleted or moved. Hence, the running time of the operations does not depend on the number of reservations previously made. The running time does not depend on the size of the interval of the reservation either. Let $n$ be the number of leaves in the data structure. In the worst case, the number of touched (i.e. traversed) nodes is in any operation $O(\log n)$, hence the running time of any operation is also $O(\log n)$.",1026,2003,,arXiv Data Structures and Algorithms,0,0,0,0,22.5,Data Structures and Algorithms,cs.DS,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0308041v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0308041v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0308041v1,cs/0308041v1

Maintaining Information in Fully-Dynamic Trees with Top Trees,"Stephen Alstrup, Jacob Holm, Kristian de Lichtenberg, Mikkel Thorup",4,"We introduce top trees as a design of a new simpler interface for data structures maintaining information in a fully-dynamic forest. We demonstrate how easy and versatile they are to use on a host of different applications. For example, we show how to maintain the diameter, center, and median of each tree in the forest. The forest can be updated by insertion and deletion of edges and by changes to vertex and edge weights. Each update is supported in O(log n) time, where n is the size of the tree(s) involved in the update. Also, we show how to support nearest common ancestor queries and level ancestor queries with respect to arbitrary roots in O(log n) time. Finally, with marked and unmarked vertices, we show how to compute distances to a nearest marked vertex. The later has applications to approximate nearest marked vertex in general graphs, and thereby to static optimization problems over shortest path metrics.

Set K-Cover Algorithms for Energy Efficient Monitoring in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Zoe Abrams, Ashish Goel, Serge Plotkin",3,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are emerging as an effective means for environment monitoring. This paper investigates a strategy for energy efficient monitoring in WSNs that partitions the sensors into covers, and then activates the covers iteratively in a round-robin fashion. This approach takes advantage of the overlap created when many sensors monitor a single area. Our work builds upon previous work in ""Power Efficient Organization of Wireless Sensor Networks"" by Slijepcevic and Potkonjak, where the model is first formulated. We have designed three approximation algorithms for a variation of the SET K-COVER problem, where the objective is to partition the sensors into covers such that the number of covers that include an area, summed over all areas, is maximized. The first algorithm is randomized and partitions the sensors, in expectation, within a fraction 1 - 1/e (~.63) of the optimum. We present two other deterministic approximation algorithms. One is a distributed greedy algorithm with a 1/2 approximation ratio and the other is a centralized greedy algorithm with a 1 - 1/e approximation ratio. We show that it is NP-Complete to guarantee better than 15/16 of the optimal coverage, indicating that all three algorithms perform well with respect to the best approximation algorithm possible. Simulations indicate that in practice, the deterministic algorithms perform far above their worst case bounds, consistently covering more than 72% of what is covered by an optimum solution. Simulations also indicate that the increase in longevity is proportional to the amount of overlap amongst the sensors. The algorithms are fast, easy to use, and according to simulations, significantly increase the longevity of sensor networks.

The Freeze-Tag Problem: How to Wake Up a Swarm of Robots,"Esther M. Arkin, Michael A. Bender, Sandor P. Fekete, Joseph S. B. Mitchell, Martin Skutella",5,"An optimization problem that naturally arises in the study of swarm robotics is the Freeze-Tag Problem (FTP) of how to awaken a set of ``asleep'' robots, by having an awakened robot move to their locations. Once a robot is awake, it can assist in awakening other slumbering robots.The objective is to have all robots awake as early as possible. While the FTP bears some resemblance to problems from areas in combinatorial optimization such as routing, broadcasting, scheduling, and covering, its algorithmic characteristics are surprisingly different. We consider both scenarios on graphs and in geometric environments.In graphs, robots sleep at vertices and there is a length function on the edges. Awake robots travel along edges, with time depending on edge length. For most scenarios, we consider the offline version of the problem, in which each awake robot knows the position of all other robots. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, even for the special case of star graphs. We also establish hardness of approximation, showing that it is NP-hard to obtain an approximation factor better than 5/3, even for graphs of bounded degree.These lower bounds are complemented with several positive algorithmic results, including: (1) We show that the natural greedy strategy on star graphs has a tight worst-case performance of 7/3 and give a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for star graphs.

Online Searching with Turn Cost,"Erik D. Demaine, Sandor P. Fekete, Shmuel Gal",3,"We consider the problem of searching for an object on a line at an unknown distance OPT from the original position of the searcher, in the presence of a cost of d for each time the searcher changes direction. This is a generalization of the well-studied linear-search problem. We describe a strategy that is guaranteed to find the object at a cost of at most 9*OPT + 2d, which has the optimal competitive ratio 9 with respect to OPT plus the minimum corresponding additive term. Our argument for upper and lower bound uses an infinite linear program, which we solve by experimental solution of an infinite series of approximating finite linear programs, estimating the limits, and solving the resulting recurrences.

Efficient Hashing with Lookups in two Memory Accesses,Rina Panigrahy,1,"The study of hashing is closely related to the analysis of balls and bins. It is well-known that instead of using a single hash function if we randomly hash a ball into two bins and place it in the smaller of the two, then this dramatically lowers the maximum load on bins. This leads to the concept of two-way hashing where the largest bucket contains $O(\log\log n)$ balls with high probability. The hash look up will now search in both the buckets an item hashes to. Since an item may be placed in one of two buckets, we could potentially move an item after it has been initially placed to reduce maximum load. with a maximum load of We show that by performing moves during inserts, a maximum load of 2 can be maintained on-line, with high probability, while supporting hash update operations. In fact, with $n$ buckets, even if the space for two items are pre-allocated per bucket, as may be desirable in hardware implementations, more than $n$ items can be stored giving a high memory utilization. We also analyze the trade-off between the number of moves performed during inserts and the maximum load on a bucket. By performing at most $h$ moves, we can maintain a maximum load of $O(\frac{\log \log n}{h \log(\log\log n/h)})$. So, even by performing one move, we achieve a better bound than by performing no moves at all.",1328,2004,,arXiv Data Structures and Algorithms,0,0,0,0,21.5,Data Structures and Algorithms,cs.DS,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0407023v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0407023v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0407023v1,cs/0407023v1

For bounded degree graphs, our algorithms take constant time per set generated; for minor-closed graph families, the time is O(n) per set, and for more general sparse graph families we achieve subquadratic time per set. We also describe new data structures for maintaining a dynamic vertex set S in a sparse or minor-closed graph family, and querying the number of vertices not dominated by S; for minor-closed graph families the time per update is constant, while it is sublinear for any sparse graph family. We can also maintain a dynamic vertex set in an arbitrary m-edge graph and test the independence of the maintained set in time O(sqrt m) per update.

Multi-Embedding of Metric Spaces,"Yair Bartal, Manor Mendel",2,"Metric embedding has become a common technique in the design of algorithms. Its applicability is often dependent on how high the embedding's distortion is. For example, embedding finite metric space into trees may require linear distortion as a function of its size. Using probabilistic metric embeddings, the bound on the distortion reduces to logarithmic in the size.   We make a step in the direction of bypassing the lower bound on the distortion in terms of the size of the metric. We define ""multi-embeddings"" of metric spaces in which a point is mapped onto a set of points, while keeping the target metric of polynomial size and preserving the distortion of paths. The distortion obtained with such multi-embeddings into ultrametrics is at most O(log Delta loglog Delta) where Delta is the aspect ratio of the metric. In particular, for expander graphs, we are able to obtain constant distortion embeddings into trees in contrast with the Omega(log n) lower bound for all previous notions of embeddings.   We demonstrate the algorithmic application of the new embeddings for two optimization problems: group Steiner tree and metrical task systems.",1155,2004,"SIAM J.

Hash sort: A linear time complexity multiple-dimensional sort algorithm,William F. Gilreath,1,"Sorting and hashing are two completely different concepts in computer science, and appear mutually exclusive to one another. Hashing is a search method using the data as a key to map to the location within memory, and is used for rapid storage and retrieval. Sorting is a process of organizing data from a random permutation into an ordered arrangement, and is a common activity performed frequently in a variety of applications.   Almost all conventional sorting algorithms work by comparison, and in doing so have a linearithmic greatest lower bound on the algorithmic time complexity. Any improvement in the theoretical time complexity of a sorting algorithm can result in overall larger gains in implementation performance.. A gain in algorithmic performance leads to much larger gains in speed for the application that uses the sort algorithm. Such a sort algorithm needs to use an alternative method for ordering the data than comparison, to exceed the linearithmic time complexity boundary on algorithmic performance.   The hash sort is a general purpose non-comparison based sorting algorithm by hashing, which has some interesting features not found in conventional sorting algorithms. The hash sort asymptotically outperforms the fastest traditional sorting algorithm, the quick sort. The hash sort algorithm has a linear time complexity factor -- even in the worst case. The hash sort opens an area for further work and investigation into alternative means of sorting.",1479,2004,Proceedings of First Southern Symposium on Computing December 1998,arXiv Data Structures and Algorithms,0,0,0,0,21.5,Data Structures and Algorithms,cs.DS,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0408040v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0408040v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0408040v1,cs/0408040v1

Enhancing Histograms by Tree-Like Bucket Indices,"Francesco Buccafurri, Gianluca Lax, Domenico Sacca', Luigi Pontieri, Domenico Rosaci",5,"Histograms are used to summarize the contents of relations into a number of buckets for the estimation of query result sizes. Several techniques (e.g., MaxDiff and V-Optimal) have been proposed in the past for determining bucket boundaries which provide accurate estimations. However, while search strategies for optimal bucket boundaries are rather sophisticated, no much attention has been paid for estimating queries inside buckets and all of the above techniques adopt naive methods for such an estimation. This paper focuses on the problem of improving the estimation inside a bucket once its boundaries have been fixed. The proposed technique is based on the addition, to each bucket, of 32-bit additional information (organized into a 4-level tree index), storing approximate cumulative frequencies at 7 internal intervals of the bucket. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that, among a number of alternative ways to organize the additional information, the 4-level tree index provides the best frequency estimation inside a bucket. The index is later added to two well-known histograms, MaxDiff and V-Optimal, obtaining the non-obvious result that despite the spatial cost of 4LT which reduces the number of allowed buckets once the storage space has been fixed, the original methods are strongly improved in terms of accuracy.",1356,2005,,arXiv Data Structures and Algorithms,0,0,0,0,20.5,Data Structures and Algorithms,cs.DS,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0501020v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0501020v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0501020v1,cs/0501020v1
On Dynamic Range Reporting in One Dimension,"Christian Worm Mortensen, Rasmus Pagh, Mihai Patrascu",3,"We consider the problem of maintaining a dynamic set of integers and answering queries of the form: report a point (equivalently, all points) in a given interval. Range searching is a natural and fundamental variant of integer search, and can be solved using predecessor search. However, for a RAM with w-bit words, we show how to perform updates in O(lg w) time and answer queries in O(lglg w) time. The update time is identical to the van Emde Boas structure, but the query time is exponentially faster. Existing lower bounds show that achieving our query time for predecessor search requires doubly-exponentially slower updates. We present some arguments supporting the conjecture that our solution is optimal.   Our solution is based on a new and interesting recursion idea which is ""more extreme"" that the van Emde Boas recursion. Whereas van Emde Boas uses a simple recursion (repeated halving) on each path in a trie, we use a nontrivial, van Emde Boas-like recursion on every such path. Despite this, our algorithm is quite clean when seen from the right angle. To achieve linear space for our data structure, we solve a problem which is of independent interest. We develop the first scheme for dynamic perfect hashing requiring sublinear space. This gives a dynamic Bloomier filter (an approximate storage scheme for sparse vectors) which uses low space.

Correlation Clustering with a Fixed Number of Clusters,"Ioannis Giotis, Venkatesan Guruswami",2,"We continue the investigation of problems concerning correlation clustering or clustering with qualitative information, which is a clustering formulation that has been studied recently. The basic setup here is that we are given as input a complete graph on n nodes (which correspond to nodes to be clustered) whose edges are labeled + (for similar pairs of items) and - (for dissimilar pairs of items). Thus we have only as input qualitative information on similarity and no quantitative distance measure between items. The quality of a clustering is measured in terms of its number of agreements, which is simply the number of edges it correctly classifies, that is the sum of number of - edges whose endpoints it places in different clusters plus the number of + edges both of whose endpoints it places within the same cluster.   In this paper, we study the problem of finding clusterings that maximize the number of agreements, and the complementary minimization version where we seek clusterings that minimize the number of disagreements. We focus on the situation when the number of clusters is stipulated to be a small constant k. Our main result is that for every k, there is a polynomial time approximation scheme for both maximizing agreements and minimizing disagreements. (The problems are NP-hard for every k >= 2.) The main technical work is for the minimization version, as the PTAS for maximizing agreements follows along the lines of the property tester for Max k-CUT.   In contrast, when the number of clusters is not specified, the problem of minimizing disagreements was shown to be APX-hard, even though the maximization version admits a PTAS.",1663,2005,,arXiv Data Structures and Algorithms,0,0,0,0,20.5,Data Structures and Algorithms,cs.DS,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0504023v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0504023v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0504023v1,cs/0504023v1

The goal is to find a set F of k facilities that minimizes the sum, over all customers, of their service costs.   Following Mettu and Plaxton, we study the incremental medians problem, where k is not known in advance, and the algorithm produces a nested sequence of facility sets where the kth set has size k. The algorithm is c-cost-competitive if the cost of each set is at most c times the cost of the optimum set of size k. We give improved incremental algorithms for the metric version: an 8-cost-competitive deterministic algorithm, a 2e ~ 5.44-cost-competitive randomized algorithm, a (24+epsilon)-cost-competitive, poly-time deterministic algorithm, and a (6e+epsilon ~ .31)-cost-competitive, poly-time randomized algorithm.

Efficient Approximation of Convex Recolorings,"Shlomo Moran, Sagi Snir",2,"A coloring of a tree is convex if the vertices that pertain to any color induce a connected subtree; a partial coloring (which assigns colors to some of the vertices) is convex if it can be completed to a convex (total) coloring. Convex coloring of trees arise in areas such as phylogenetics, linguistics, etc. eg, a perfect phylogenetic tree is one in which the states of each character induce a convex coloring of the tree. Research on perfect phylogeny is usually focused on finding a tree so that few predetermined partial colorings of its vertices are convex.   When a coloring of a tree is not convex, it is desirable to know ""how far"" it is from a convex one. In [19], a natural measure for this distance, called the recoloring distance was defined: the minimal number of color changes at the vertices needed to make the coloring convex. This can be viewed as minimizing the number of ""exceptional vertices"" w.r.t. to a closest convex coloring. The problem was proved to be NP-hard even for colored string.   In this paper we continue the work of [19], and present a 2-approximation algorithm of convex recoloring of strings whose running time O(cn), where c is the number of colors and n is the size of the input, and an O(cn^2)-time 3-approximation algorithm for convex recoloring of trees.",1299,2005,,arXiv Data Structures and Algorithms,0,0,0,0,20.5,Data Structures and Algorithms,cs.DS,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0505077v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0505077v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0505077v1,cs/0505077v1

"Measures on contour, polymer or animal models. A probabilistic approach","Roberto Fernández, Pablo A. Ferrari, Nancy L. Garcia",3,"We present a new approach to study measures on ensembles of contours, polymers or other objects interacting by some sort of exclusion condition. For concreteness we develop it here for the case of Peierls contours. Unlike existing methods, which are based on cluster-expansion formalisms and/or complex analysis, our method is strictly probabilistic and hence can be applied even in the absence of analyticity properties. It involves a Harris graphical construction of a loss network for which the measure of interest is invariant. The existence of the process and its mixing properties depend on the absence of infinite clusters for a dual (backwards) oriented percolation process which we dominate by a multitype branching process. Within the region of subcriticality of this branching process the approach yields: (i) exponential convergence to the equilibrium (=contour) measures, (ii) standard clustering and finite-effect properties of the contour measure, (iii) a particularly strong form of the central limit theorem, and (iv) a Poisson approximation for the distribution of contours at low temperature.",1111,1998,"Markov Process.

Our probabilistic argument uses the idea of good and bad historical paths of reactant `particles' during time periods $[T_{n},T_{n+1})$. Good paths have a significant collision local time with the catalyst, and extinction can be shown by individual time change according to the collision local time and a comparison with Feller's branching diffusion.

In this paper we show that for bounded Lipschitz domains, the Martin boundary with respect to the killed stable process $X^D$ can be identified with the Euclidean boundary. We further give integral representations for both kinds of positive harmonic functions.

Extinction for two parabolic stochastic PDE's on the lattice,"C. Mueller, E. Perkins",2,"It is well known that, starting with finite mass, the super-Brownian motion dies out in finite time. The goal of this article is to show that with some additional work, one can prove finite time die-out for two types of systems of stochastic differential equations on the lattice Z^d. Our first system involves the heat equation on the lattice Z^d, with a nonlinear noise term u(t,x)^gamma dB_x(t), with 1/2 <= gamma < 1. The B_x are independent Brownian motions. When gamma = 1/2, the measure which puts mass u(t,x) at x is a super-random walk and it is well-known that the process becomes extinct in finite time a.s. Finite-time extinction is known to be a.s. false if gamma = 1. For 1/2 < gamma < 1, we show finite-time die-out by breaking up the solution into pieces, and showing that each piece dies in finite time. Our second example involves the mutually catalytic branching system of stochastic differential equations on Z^d, which was first studied by Dawson and Perkins. Roughly speaking, this process consists of 2 superprocesses with the continuous time simple random walk as the underlying spatial motion. Furthermore, each process stimulates branching and dying in the other process.

We outline a mathematical theory of tension based on graph rigidity theory and introduce several probabilistic models for this problem. We show that if the ``centers'' of the holes are distributed in R^2 according to Poisson law with parameter \lambda>0, and the distribution of sizes of the holes is independent of the distribution of their centers, the tension vanishes on all of R^2 for any value of \lambda. In fact, it follows from a more general result on the behavior of iterative convex hulls of connected subsets of R^d, when the initial configuration of subsets is distributed according to Poisson law and the sizes of the elements of the original configuration are independent of this Poisson distribution. For the latter problem we establish the existence of a critical threshold in terms of the number of iterative convex hull operations required for covering all of R^d.

The method is related to coupling from the past (CFTP), but only runs the Markov chain forwards in time, and never restarts it at previous times in the past. The method is also related to an idea known as PASTA (Poisson arrivals see time averages) in the operations research literature. Because the new algorithm can be run using a read-once stream of randomness, we call it read-once CFTP. The memory and time requirements of read-once CFTP are on par with the requirements of the usual form of CFTP, and for a variety of applications the requirements may be noticeably less. Some perfect sampling algorithms for point processes are based on an extension of CFTP known as coupling into and from the past; for completeness, we give a read-once version of coupling into and from the past, but it remains unpractical. For these point process applications, we give an alternative coupling method with which read-once CFTP may be efficiently used.",1056,1999,"Random Structures and Algorithms 16(1):85--113, 2000",arXiv Probability,0,0,0,0,26.5,Probability,math.PR,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9910050v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9910050v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9910050v1,math/9910050v1

Layered Multishift Coupling for use in Perfect Sampling Algorithms (with a primer on CFTP),David Bruce Wilson,1,"In this article we describe a new coupling technique which is useful in a variety of perfect sampling algorithms. A multishift coupler generates a random function f() so that for each real x, f(x)-x is governed by the same fixed probability distribution, such as a normal distribution. We develop the class of layered multishift couplers, which are simple and have several useful properties. For the standard normal distribution, for instance, the layered multishift coupler generates an f() which (surprisingly) maps an interval of length L to fewer than 2+L/2.35 points --- useful in applications which perform computations on each such image point. The layered multishift coupler improves and simplifies algorithms for generating perfectly random samples from several distributions, including the autogamma distribution, posterior distributions for Bayesian inference, and the steady state distribution for certain storage systems. We also use the layered multishift coupler to develop a Markov-chain based perfect sampling algorithm for the autonormal distribution.   At the request of the organizers, we begin by giving a primer on CFTP (coupling from the past); CFTP and Fill's algorithm are the two predominant techniques for generating perfectly random samples using coupled Markov chains.",1297,1999,"Monte Carlo Methods, Fields Institute Communications vol. 26,

Path-wise solutions of SDE's driven by Levy processes,David R. E.

There are two types of solution, determined by the solution's behaviour at jump times of the process X, one we call geometric the other forward. The geometric solution is obtained by adding fictitious time and solving an associated integral equation. The forward solution is derived from the geometric solution by correcting the solution's jump behaviour. L\'evy processes, generally, have unbounded variation. So we must use a pathwise integral different from the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral. When X has finite p-variation almost surely for p<2 we use Young's integral. This is defined whenever f and g have finite p and q-variation for 1/p+1/q>1 (and they have no common discontinuities). When p>2 we use the integral of Lyons.

Markov Transitions and the Propagation of Chaos,Alexander David Gottlieb,1,"The propagation of chaos is a central concept of kinetic theory that serves to relate the equations of Boltzmann and Vlasov to the dynamics of many-particle systems. Propagation of chaos means that molecular chaos, i.e., the stochastic independence of two random particles in a many-particle system, persists in time, as the number of particles tends to infinity.   We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of general n-particle Markov processes to propagate chaos. This condition is expressed in terms of the Markov transition functions associated to the n-particle processes, and it amounts to saying that chaos of random initial states propagates if it propagates for pure initial states.   Our proof of this result relies on the weak convergence approach to the study of chaos due to Sznitman and Tanaka. We assume that the space in which the particles live is homeomorphic to a complete and separable metric space so that we may invoke Prohorov's theorem in our proof.   We also show that, if the particles can be in only finitely many states, then molecular chaos implies that the specific entropies in the n-particle distributions converge to the entropy of the limiting single-particle distribution.",1229,2000,,arXiv Probability,0,0,0,0,25.5,Probability,math.PR,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0001076v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0001076v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0001076v1,math/0001076v1

The identification capacity and resolvability of channels with input cost constraint,Te Sun Han,1,"Given a general channel, we first formulate the idetification capacity problem as well as the resolvability problem with input cost constraint in as the general form as possible, along with relevant fundamental theorems. Next, we establish some mild sufficient condition for the key lemma linking the identification capacity with the resolvability to hold for the continuous input alphabet case with input cost constraint. Under this mild condition, it is shown that we can reach the {\em continuous}-input fundamental theorem of the same form as that for the fundamental theorem with {\em finite} input alphabet. Finally, as important examples of this continuous-input fundamental theorem, we show that the identification capacity as well as the resolvability coincides with the channel capacity for stationary additive white (and also non-white) Gaussian noise channels.",872,2000,,arXiv Probability,0,0,0,0,25.5,Probability,math.PR,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0005073v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0005073v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0005073v1,math/0005073v1
On the critical exponents of random k-SAT,David B. Wilson,1,"There has been much recent interest in the satisfiability of random Boolean formulas. A random k-SAT formula is the conjunction of m random clauses, each of which is the disjunction of k literals (a variable or its negation). It is known that when the number of variables n is large, there is a sharp transition from satisfiability to unsatisfiability; in the case of 2-SAT this happens when m/n --> 1, for 3-SAT the critical ratio is thought to be m/n ~ 4.2. The sharpness of this transition is characterized by a critical exponent, sometimes called \nu=\nu_k (the smaller the value of \nu the sharper the transition). Experiments have suggested that \nu_3 = 1.5+-0.1, \nu_4 = 1.25+-0.05, \nu_5=1.1+-0.05, \nu_6 = 1.05+-0.05, and heuristics have suggested that \nu_k --> 1 as k --> infinity. We give here a simple proof that each of these exponents is at least 2 (provided the exponent is well-defined). This result holds for each of the three standard ensembles of random k-SAT formulas: m clauses selected uniformly at random without replacement, m clauses selected uniformly at random with replacement, and each clause selected with probability p independent of the other clauses. We also obtain similar results for q-colorability and the appearance of a q-core in a random graph.",1284,2000,"Random Structures and Algorithms, 21(2):182--195, 2002",arXiv Probability,0,0,0,0,25.5,Probability,math.PR,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0005136v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0005136v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0005136v2,math/0005136v2
Occupation Time Fluctuations in Branching Systems,"Don Dawson, L. G. Gorostiza, A. Wakolbinger",3,"We consider particle systems in locally compact Abelian groups with particles moving according to a process with symmetric stationary independent increments and undergoing one and two levels of critical branching. We obtain long time fluctuation limits for the occupation time process of the one-and two-level systems. We give complete results for the case of finite variance branching, where the fluctuation limits are Gaussian random fields, and partial results for an example of infinite variance branching, where the fluctuation limits are stable random fields. The asymptotics of the occupation time fluctuations are determined by the Green potential operator G of the individual particle motion and its powers $G^2, G^3$, and by the growth as $t\to\infty$ of the operator $G_t=\int^t_0T_sds$ and its powers, where $T_t$ is the semigroup of the motion. The results are illustrated with two examples of motions: the symmetric $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process in $\erre^d$ $(0<\alpha\leq2)$,and the so called c-hierarchical random walk in the hierarchical group of order N (0<c<N). We show that the two motions have analogous asymptotics of $G_t$ and its powers that depend on an order parameter $\gamma$ for their transience /recurrence behavior. This parameter is $\gamma=d/\alpha-1$ for the $\alpha$-stable motion, and $\gamma=\log c/\log (N/c)$ for the c-hierarchical random walk. As a consequence of these analogies, the asymptotics of the occupation time fluctuations of the corresponding branching particle systems are also analogous. In the case of the c-hierarchical random walk, however, the growth of $G_t$ and its powers is modulated by oscillations on a logarithmic time scale.",1691,2000,,arXiv Probability,0,0,0,0,25.5,Probability,math.PR,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0005231v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0005231v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0005231v1,math/0005231v1

We prove that the weak solution chosen by the particle system is the unique one with maximal current past any fixed location. A uniqueness result is needed because we can prove neither differentiability nor strict concavity of the flux function, so we cannot use the Lax-Oleinik formula or jump conditions to define entropy solutions. Next we prove laws of large numbers for a second class particle in K-exclusion. The macroscopic trajectories of second class particles are characteristics and shocks of the conservation law for the particle density. In particular, we extend to K-exclusion Ferrari's result that the second class particle follows a macroscopic shock in the Riemann solution.

The Randomness Recycler: A new technique for perfect sampling,"James Allen Fill, Mark L. Huber",2,"For many probability distributions of interest, it is quite difficult to obtain samples efficiently. Often, Markov chains are employed to obtain approximately random samples from these distributions. The primary drawback to traditional Markov chain methods is that the mixing time of the chain is usually unknown, which makes it impossible to determine how close the output samples are to having the target distribution. Here we present a new protocol, the randomness recycler (RR), that overcomes this difficulty. Unlike classical Markov chain approaches, an RR-based algorithm creates samples drawn exactly from the desired distribution. Other perfect sampling methods such as coupling from the past use existing Markov chains, but RR does not use the traditional Markov chain at all. While by no means universally useful, RR does apply to a wide variety of problems. In restricted instances of certain problems, it gives the first expected linear time algorithms for generating samples. Here we apply RR to self-organizing lists, the Ising model, random independent sets, random colorings, and the random cluster model.",1122,2000,,arXiv Probability,0,0,0,0,25.5,Probability,math.PR,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0009242v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0009242v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0009242v1,math/0009242v1

Microscopic shape of shocks in a domain growth model,Marton Balazs,1,"Considering the hydrodynamical limit of some interacting particle systems leads to hyperbolic differential equation for the conserved quantities, e.g. the inviscid Burgers equation for the simple exclusion process. The physical solutions of these partial differential equations develop discontinuities, called shocks. The microscopic structure of these shocks is of much interest and far from being well understood. We introduce a domain growth model in which we find a stationary (in time) product measure for the model, as seen from a defect tracer or second class particle, travelling with the shock. We also show that under some natural assumptions valid for a wider class of domain growth models, no other model has stationary product measure as seen from the moving defect tracer.",786,2001,"Journal of Stat.

Emerging applications of geometric multiscale analysis,David L. Donoho,1,"Classical multiscale analysis based on wavelets has a number of successful applications, e.g. in data compression, fast algorithms, and noise removal. Wavelets, however, are adapted to point singularities, and many phenomena in several variables exhibit intermediate-dimensional singularities, such as edges, filaments, and sheets. This suggests that in higher dimensions, wavelets ought to be replaced in certain applications by multiscale analysis adapted to intermediate-dimensional singularities.   My lecture described various initial attempts in this direction. In particular, I discussed two approaches to geometric multiscale analysis originally arising in the work of Harmonic Analysts Hart Smith and Peter Jones (and others): (a) a directional wavelet transform based on parabolic dilations; and (b) analysis via anistropic strips. Perhaps surprisingly, these tools have potential applications in data compression, inverse problems, noise removal, and signal detection; applied mathematicians, statisticians, and engineers are eagerly pursuing these leads.",1066,2002,"Proceedings of the ICM, Beijing 2002, vol. 1, 209--233",arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,23.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0212395v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0212395v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0212395v1,math/0212395v1
"Hidden Markov and state space models: asymptotic analysis of exact and approximate methods for prediction, filtering, smoothing and statistical inference","Peter Bickel, Yaacov Ritov, Tobias Rydén",3,"State space models have long played an important role in signal processing. The Gaussian case can be treated algorithmically using the famous Kalman filter. Similarly since the 1970s there has been extensive application of Hidden Markov models in speech recognition with prediction being the most important goal. The basic theoretical work here, in the case $X$ and $Y$ finite (small) providing both algorithms and asymptotic analysis for inference is that of Baum and colleagues. During the last 30-40 years these general models have proved of great value in applications ranging from genomics to finance.   Unless the $X,Y$ are jointly Gaussian or $X$ is finite and small the problem of calculating the distributions discussed and the likelihood exactly are numerically intractable and if $Y$ is not finite asymptotic analysis becomes much more difficult. Some new developments have been the construction of so-called ``particle filters'' (Monte Carlo type) methods for approximate calculation of these distributions (see Doucet et al. [4]) for instance and general asymptotic methods for analysis of statistical methods in HMM [2] and other authors.   We will discuss these methods and results in the light of exponential mixing properties of the conditional (posterior) distribution of $(X_1,X_2,...)$ given $(Y_1,Y_2,...)$ already noted by Baum and Petrie and recent work of the authors Bickel, Ritov and Ryden, Del Moral and Jacod, Douc and Matias.",1454,2002,"Proceedings of the ICM, Beijing 2002, vol. 1, 555--556",arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,23.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0212410v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0212410v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0212410v1,math/0212410v1
Statistical equivalence and stochastic process limit theorems,Lawrence D. Brown,1,"A classical limit theorem of stochastic process theory concerns the sample cumulative distribution function (CDF) from independent random variables. If the variables are uniformly distributed then these centered CDFs converge in a suitable sense to the sample paths of a Brownian Bridge. The so-called Hungarian construction of Komlos, Major and Tusnady provides a strong form of this result. In this construction the CDFs and the Brownian Bridge sample paths are coupled through an appropriate representation of each on the same measurable space, and the convergence is uniform at a suitable rate.   Within the last decade several asymptotic statistical-equivalence theorems for nonparametric problems have been proven, beginning with Brown and Low (1996) and Nussbaum (1996). The approach here to statistical-equivalence is firmly rooted within the asymptotic statistical theory created by L. Le Cam but in some respects goes beyond earlier results.   This talk demonstrates the analogy between these results and those from the coupling method for proving stochastic process limit theorems. These two classes of theorems possess a strong inter-relationship, and technical methods from each domain can profitably be employed in the other.

Nonparametric Estimation in the Model of Moving Average,Alexander Alekseev,1,"The subject of robust estimation in time series is widely discussed in literature. One of the approaches is to use GM-estimation. This method incorporates a broad class of nonparametric estimators which under suitable conditions includes estimators robust to outliers in data. For the linear models the sensitivity of GM-estimators to outliers have been studied in the work by Martin and Yohai [5], and influence functionals for this estimator were derived. In this paper we follow this direction and examine the asymptotical properties of the class of M-estimators, which is narrower than the class of GM-estimators, but gives more insight into asymptotical properties of such estimators. This paper gives an asymptotic expansion of the residual weighted empirical process, which allows to prove asymptotic normality of these estimators in case of non-smooth objective functions. For simplicity MA(1) model is considered, but it will be shown that even in this case mathematical techniques used to derive these asymptotic properties appear to be rather complicated.However, the approach used in this paper could be applied to GM-estimators and to more realistic models.",1170,2003,,arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,22.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0312056v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0312056v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0312056v1,math/0312056v1

In this article, we present a new perspective for the GoM model, based on considering distribution laws of observed random variables as realizations of another random variable.

The framework is developed as a set of sufficient conditions for the existence of such factorizations, formulated in analogy to those underlying a standard multiresolution analysis for wavelets, and hence can be viewed as a multiresolution analysis for likelihoods. We then consider the use of these factorizations in the task of nonparametric, complexity penalized likelihood estimation. We study the risk properties of certain thresholding and partitioning estimators, and demonstrate their adaptivity and near-optimality, in a minimax sense over a broad range of function spaces, based on squared Hellinger distance as a loss function.

Statistical inference for time-inhomogeneous volatility models,"Danilo Mercurio, Vladimir Spokoiny",2,"This paper offers a new approach for estimating and forecasting the volatility of financial time series. No assumption is made about the parametric form of the processes. On the contrary, we only suppose that the volatility can be approximated by a constant over some interval. In such a framework, the main problem consists of filtering this interval of time homogeneity; then the estimate of the volatility can be simply obtained by local averaging.   We construct a locally adaptive volatility estimate (LAVE) which can perform this task and investigate it both from the theoretical point of view and through Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the LAVE procedure is applied to a data set of nine exchange rates and a comparison with a standard GARCH model is also provided.

We construct an even better estimator using the representation of the observations as infinite-order moving averages of the innovations. Then the expectation of the function under the stationary distribution can be written as the expectation under the distribution of an infinite series in terms of the innovations, and it can be estimated by a U-statistic of increasing order   (also called an ``infinite-order U-statistic'') in terms of the estimated innovations.

Selecting optimal multistep predictors for autoregressive processes of unknown order,Ching-Kang Ing,1,"We consider the problem of choosing the optimal (in the sense of mean-squared prediction error) multistep predictor for an autoregressive (AR) process of finite but unknown order. If a working AR model (which is possibly misspecified) is adopted for multistep predictions, then two competing types of multistep predictors (i.e., plug-in and direct predictors) can be obtained from this model. We provide some interesting examples to show that when both plug-in and direct predictors are considered, the optimal multistep prediction results cannot be guaranteed by correctly identifying the underlying model's order. This finding challenges the traditional model (order) selection criteria, which usually aim to choose the order of the true model. A new prediction selection criterion, which attempts to seek the best combination of the prediction order and the prediction method, is proposed to rectify this difficulty.

We obtain second-order approximation to the MSE as well as an estimator of the MSE correct to the same order. The general results are applied to mixed linear models to obtain a second-order approximation to the MSE of the empirical best linear unbiased predictor (EBLUP) of a linear mixed effect and an estimator of the MSE of EBLUP whose bias is correct to second order. The general mixed linear model includes the mixed ANOVA model and the longitudinal model as special cases.",919,2004,"Annals of Statistics 2004, Vol. 32, No. 2, 818-840",arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,21.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0406455v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0406455v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0406455v1,math/0406455v1
Least Angle Regression,"Bradley Efron, Trevor Hastie, Iain Johnstone, Robert Tibshirani",4,"The purpose of model selection algorithms such as All Subsets, Forward   Selection and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear model on the basis of the same set of data to which the model will be applied. Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods.   Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods.   (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method;",1036,2004,"Annals of Statistics 2004, Vol. 32, No. 2, 407-451",arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,21.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0406456v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0406456v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0406456v2,math/0406456v2
Training samples in objective Bayesian model selection,"James O. Berger, Luis R. Pericchi",2,"Central to several objective approaches to Bayesian model selection is the use of training samples (subsets of the data), so as to allow utilization of improper objective priors. The most common prescription for choosing training samples is to choose them to be as small as possible, subject to yielding proper posteriors; these are called minimal training samples.   When data can vary widely in terms of either information content or impact on the improper priors, use of minimal training samples can be inadequate.   Important examples include certain cases of discrete data, the presence of censored observations, and certain situations involving linear models and explanatory variables. Such situations require more sophisticated methods of choosing training samples. A variety of such methods are developed in this paper, and successfully applied in challenging situations.",879,2004,"Annals of Statistics 2004, Vol. 32, No. 3, 841-869",arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,21.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0406460v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0406460v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0406460v1,math/0406460v1

Optimal predictive model selection,"Maria Maddalena Barbieri, James O. Berger",2,"Often the goal of model selection is to choose a model for future prediction, and it is natural to measure the accuracy of a future prediction by squared error loss. Under the Bayesian approach, it is commonly perceived that the optimal predictive model is the model with highest posterior probability, but this is not necessarily the case. In this paper we show that, for selection among normal linear models, the optimal predictive model is often the median probability model, which is defined as the model consisting of those variables which have overall posterior probability greater than or equal to 1/2 of being in a model. The median probability model often differs from the highest probability model.",708,2004,"Annals of Statistics 2004, Vol. 32, No. 3, 870-897",arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,21.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0406464v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0406464v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0406464v1,math/0406464v1

Nonconcave penalized likelihood with a diverging number of parameters,"Jianqing Fan, Heng Peng",2,"A class of variable selection procedures for parametric models via nonconcave penalized likelihood was proposed by Fan and Li to simultaneously estimate parameters and select important variables. They demonstrated that this class of procedures has an oracle property when the number of parameters is finite. However, in most model selection problems the number of parameters should be large and grow with the sample size. In this paper some asymptotic properties of the nonconcave penalized likelihood are established for situations in which the number of parameters tends to \infty as the sample size increases.   Under regularity conditions we have established an oracle property and the asymptotic normality of the penalized likelihood estimators. Furthermore, the consistency of the sandwich formula of the covariance matrix is demonstrated.

The advantage of this transform is that the corresponding tests are asymptotically distribution free.

Density estimation for biased data,Sam Efromovich,1,"The concept of biased data is well known and its practical applications range from social sciences and biology to economics and quality control.   These observations arise when a sampling procedure chooses an observation with probability that depends on the value of the observation. This is an interesting sampling procedure because it favors some observations and neglects others. It is known that biasing does not change rates of nonparametric density estimation, but no results are available about sharp constants.   This article presents asymptotic results on sharp minimax density estimation.   In particular, a coefficient of difficulty is introduced that shows the relationship between sample sizes of direct and biased samples that imply the same accuracy of estimation. The notion of the restricted local minimax, where a low-frequency part of the estimated density is known, is introduced; it sheds new light on the phenomenon of nonparametric superefficiency.

A class of estimators that have multiplicative adjustment is provided, including estimators proposed by several authors as special cases, and the asymptotic theories are developed.

Estimation of fractal dimension for a class of Non-Gaussian stationary processes and fields,"Grace Chan, Andrew T. A.

The relevant theoretical framework here is ``fixed domain'' (or ``infill'') asymptotics. Surprisingly, the limit theory in this non-Gaussian case is somewhat richer than in the Gaussian case (the latter is recovered when g is affine), in part because estimators of the type considered may have an asymptotic variance which is random in the limit. Broadly, when g is smooth and nonaffine, three types of limit distributions can arise, types (i), (ii) and (iii), say. Each type can be represented as a random integral. More specifically, type (i) can be represented as the integral of a certain random function with respect to Lebesgue measure; type (ii) can be represented as the integral of a second random function",1041,2004,"Annals of Statistics 2004, Vol. 32, No. 3, 1222-1260",arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,21.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0406525v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0406525v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0406525v1,math/0406525v1

Monomial ideals and the Scarf complex for coherent systems in reliability theory,"Beatrice Giglio, Henry P.

The idea is to relate a coherent system to monomial ideals, so that the so-called Scarf complex of the monomial ideal yields an inclusion-exclusion identity for the probability of failure, which uses many fewer terms than the classical identity. Moreover in the ``general position'' case we obtain via the Scarf complex the tube bounds given by Naiman and Wynn [J. Inequal. Pure Appl. Math. (2001) 2 1-16].

The results demonstrate that the best achievable rates of convergence are determined both by smoothness of the function away from the change-point and by the degree of ill-posedness of the convolution operator.

Mimicking counterfactual outcomes to estimate causal effects,Judith J. Lok,1,"In observational studies, treatment may be adapted to covariates at several times without a fixed protocol, in continuous time. Treatment influences covariates, which influence treatment, which influences covariates, and so on. Then even time-dependent Cox-models cannot be used to estimate the net treatment effect. Structural nested models have been applied in this setting. Structural nested models are based on counterfactuals: the outcome a person would have had had treatment been withheld after a certain time. Previous work on continuous-time structural nested models assumes that counterfactuals depend deterministically on observed data, while conjecturing that this assumption can be relaxed. This article proves that one can mimic counterfactuals by constructing random variables, solutions to a differential equation, that have the same distribution as the counterfactuals, even given past observed data. These ""mimicking"" variables can be used to estimate the parameters of structural nested models without assuming the treatment effect to be deterministic.",1071,2004,,arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,21.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0409045v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0409045v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0409045v2,math/0409045v2
Estimating the causal effect of a time-varying treatment on time-to-event using structural nested failure time models,"J. J. Lok, R. D. Gill, A. W. van der Vaart, J. M. Robins",4,"In this paper we review an approach to estimating the causal effect of a time-varying treatment on time to some event of interest. This approach is designed for the situation where the treatment may have been repeatedly adapted to patient characteristics, which themselves may also be time-dependent. In this situation the effect of the treatment cannot simply be estimated by conditioning on the patient characteristics, as these may themselves be indicators of the treatment effect. This so-called time-dependent confounding is typical in observational studies. We discuss a new class of failure time models, structural nested failure time models, which can be used to estimate the causal effect of a time-varying treatment, and present methods for estimating and testing the parameters of these models.",805,2004,"Statistica Neerlandica (2004), vol. 58, 271-295",arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,21.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0409165v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0409165v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0409165v1,math/0409165v1
Estimating marginal survival function by adjusting for dependent censoring using many covariates,Donglin Zeng,1,"One goal in survival analysis of right-censored data is to estimate the marginal survival function in the presence of dependent censoring. When many auxiliary covariates are sufficient to explain the dependent censoring, estimation based on either a semiparametric model or a nonparametric model of the conditional survival function can be problematic due to the high dimensionality of the auxiliary information. In this paper, we use two working models to condense these high-dimensional covariates in dimension reduction; then an estimate of the marginal survival function can be derived nonparametrically in a low-dimensional space. We show that such an estimator has the following double robust property: when either working model is correct, the estimator is consistent and asymptotically Gaussian; when both working models are correct, the asymptotic variance attains the efficiency bound.",895,2004,"Annals of Statistics 2004, Vol. 32, No. 4, 1533-1555",arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,21.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0409180v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0409180v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0409180v2,math/0409180v2

Causal Inference for Complex Longitudinal Data: The Continuous Time g-Computation Formula,"R. D. Gill, J. M.

In particular we establish versions of the key results of the discrete theory: the g-computation formula and a collection of powerful characterizations of the g-null hypothesis of no treatment effect. This is accomplished under natural continuity hypotheses concerning the conditional distributions of the outcome variable and of the covariates given the past.

We assume that the unknown density $f$ belongs to a class $\mathcal{A}$ of densities whose characteristic function is described by the exponent $\exp(-\alpha |u|^r)$ as $|u|\to \infty$, where $\alpha >0$, $r>0$. The noise density is supposed to be known and such that its characteristic function decays as $\exp(-\beta |u|^s)$, as $|u| \to \infty$, where $\beta >0$, $s>0$. Assuming that $r<s$, we suggest a kernel type estimator that is optimal in sharp asymptotical minimax sense on $\mathcal{A}$ simultaneously under the pointwise and the $\mathbb{L}_2$-risks. The variance of the estimators turns out to be asymptotically negligible w.r.t. its squared bias. For $r<s/2$ we construct a sharp adaptive estimator of $f$.

Higher criticism for detecting sparse heterogeneous mixtures,"David Donoho, Jiashun Jin",2,"Higher criticism, or second-level significance testing, is a multiple-comparisons concept mentioned in passing by Tukey. It concerns a situation where there are many independent tests of significance and one is interested in rejecting the joint null hypothesis. Tukey suggested comparing the fraction of observed significances at a given \alpha-level to the expected fraction under the joint null. In fact, he suggested standardizing the difference of the two quantities and forming a z-score; the resulting z-score tests the significance of the body of significance tests. We consider a generalization, where we maximize this z-score over a range of significance levels 0<\alpha\leq\alpha_0.   We are able to show that the resulting higher criticism statistic is effective at resolving a very subtle testing problem: testing whether n normal means are all zero versus the alternative that a small fraction is nonzero. The subtlety of this ``sparse normal means'' testing problem can be seen from work of Ingster and Jin, who studied such problems in great detail. In their studies, they identified an interesting range of cases where the small fraction of nonzero means is so small that the alternative hypothesis exhibits little noticeable effect on the distribution of the p-values either for the bulk of the tests or for the few most highly significant tests.   In this range, when the amplitude of nonzero means is calibrated with the fraction of nonzero means, the likelihood ratio test for a precisely specified alternative would still succeed in separating the two hypotheses.",1584,2004,"Annals of Statistics 2004, Vol. 32, No. 3, 962-994",arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,21.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0410072v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0410072v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0410072v1,math/0410072v1
Breakdown points for maximum likelihood estimators of location-scale mixtures,Christian Hennig,1,"ML-estimation based on mixtures of Normal distributions is a widely used tool for cluster analysis. However, a single outlier can make the parameter estimation of at least one of the mixture components break down. Among others, the estimation of mixtures of t-distributions by McLachlan and   Peel [Finite Mixture Models (2000) Wiley, New York] and the addition of a further mixture component accounting for ``noise'' by Fraley and Raftery   [The Computer J. 41 (1998) 578-588] were suggested as more robust alternatives.   In this paper, the definition of an adequate robustness measure for cluster analysis is discussed and bounds for the breakdown points of the mentioned methods are given. It turns out that the two alternatives, while adding stability in the presence of outliers of moderate size, do not possess a substantially better breakdown behavior than estimation based on Normal mixtures. If the number of clusters s is treated as fixed, r additional points suffice for all three methods to let the parameters of r clusters explode. Only in the case of r=s is this not possible for t-mixtures. The ability to estimate the number of mixture components, for example, by use of the Bayesian information criterion of Schwarz [Ann. Statist. 6 (1978)   461-464], and to isolate gross outliers as clusters of one point, is crucial for an improved breakdown behavior of all three techniques. Furthermore, a mixture of Normals with an improper uniform distribution is proposed to achieve more robustness in the case of a fixed number of components.",1552,2004,"Annals of Statistics 2004, Vol. 32, No. 4, 1313-1340",arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,21.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0410073v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0410073v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0410073v1,math/0410073v1

In this article we study the rate of robustness improvement with respect to the number of observations n. Three usual measures of posterior global robustness are considered: the (range of the) Bayes actions set derived from a class of loss functions, the maximum regret of using a particular loss when the subjective loss belongs to a given class and the range of the posterior expected loss when the loss function ranges over a class. We show that the rate of convergence of the first measure of robustness is \sqrtn, while it is n for the other measures under reasonable assumptions on the class of loss functions.

"Game theory, maximum entropy, minimum discrepancy and robust Bayesian decision theory","Peter D. Grunwald, A. Philip Dawid",2,"We describe and develop a close relationship between two problems that have customarily been regarded as distinct: that of maximizing entropy, and that of minimizing worst-case expected loss. Using a formulation grounded in the equilibrium theory of zero-sum games between Decision Maker and   Nature, these two problems are shown to be dual to each other, the solution to each providing that to the other. Although Tops\oe described this connection for the Shannon entropy over 20 years ago, it does not appear to be widely known even in that important special case. We here generalize this theory to apply to arbitrary decision problems and loss functions. We indicate how an appropriate generalized definition of entropy can be associated with such a problem, and we show that, subject to certain regularity conditions, the above-mentioned duality continues to apply in this extended context.   This simultaneously provides a possible rationale for maximizing entropy and a tool for finding robust Bayes acts. We also describe the essential identity between the problem of maximizing entropy and that of minimizing a related discrepancy or divergence between distributions. This leads to an extension, to arbitrary discrepancies, of a well-known minimax theorem for the case of Kullback-Leibler divergence (the ``redundancy-capacity theorem'' of information theory). For the important case of families of distributions having certain mean values specified, we develop simple sufficient conditions and methods for identifying the desired solutions.",1550,2004,"Annals of Statistics 2004, Vol. 32, No. 4, 1367-1433",arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,21.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0410076v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0410076v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0410076v1,math/0410076v1
Uniform asymptotics for robust location estimates when the scale is unknown,"Matias Salibian-Barrera, Ruben H. Zamar",2,"Most asymptotic results for robust estimates rely on regularity conditions that are difficult to verify in practice. Moreover, these results apply to fixed distribution functions. In the robustness context the distribution of the data remains largely unspecified and hence results that hold uniformly over a set of possible distribution functions are of theoretical and practical interest. Also, it is desirable to be able to determine the size of the set of distribution functions where the uniform properties hold. In this paper we study the problem of obtaining verifiable regularity conditions that suffice to yield uniform consistency and uniform asymptotic normality for location robust estimates when the scale of the errors is unknown.   We study M-location estimates calculated with an S-scale and we obtain uniform asymptotic results over contamination neighborhoods. Moreover, we show how to calculate the maximum size of the contamination neighborhoods where these uniform results hold. There is a trade-off between the size of these neighborhoods and the breakdown point of the scale estimate.",1106,2004,"Annals of Statistics 2004, Vol. 32, No. 4, 1434-1447",arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,21.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0410079v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0410079v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0410079v1,math/0410079v1
Robust Inference for Univariate Proportional Hazards Frailty Regression Models,"Michael R. Kosorok, Bee Leng Lee, Jason P. Fine",3,"We consider a class of semiparametric regression models which are one-parameter extensions of the Cox [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 34 (1972) 187-220] model for right-censored univariate failure times. These models assume that the hazard given the covariates and a random frailty unique to each individual has the proportional hazards form multiplied by the frailty.   The frailty is assumed to have mean 1 within a known one-parameter family of distributions. Inference is based on a nonparametric likelihood. The behavior of the likelihood maximizer is studied under general conditions where the fitted model may be misspecified. The joint estimator of the regression and frailty parameters as well as the baseline hazard is shown to be uniformly consistent for the pseudo-value maximizing the asymptotic limit of the likelihood. Appropriately standardized, the estimator converges weakly to a Gaussian process. When the model is correctly specified, the procedure is semiparametric efficient, achieving the semiparametric information bound for all parameter components. It is also proved that the bootstrap gives valid inferences for all parameters, even under misspecification.   We demonstrate analytically the importance of the robust inference in several examples. In a randomized clinical trial, a valid test of the treatment effect is possible when other prognostic factors and the frailty distribution are both misspecified. Under certain conditions on the covariates, the ratios of the regression parameters are still identifiable.

Unlike some other existing estimators, the proposed estimator does not rely on any more data than strictly necessary for Thomas' estimator and is easily computable from a closed form estimating equation with a unique solution.

Needles and straw in haystacks: Empirical Bayes estimates of possibly sparse sequences,"Iain M. Johnstone, Bernard W. Silverman",2,"An empirical Bayes approach to the estimation of possibly sparse sequences observed in Gaussian white noise is set out and investigated. The prior considered is a mixture of an atom of probability at zero and a heavy-tailed density \gamma, with the mixing weight chosen by marginal maximum likelihood, in the hope of adapting between sparse and dense sequences. If estimation is then carried out using the posterior median, this is a random thresholding procedure. Other thresholding rules employing the same threshold can also be used. Probability bounds on the threshold chosen by the marginal maximum likelihood approach lead to overall risk bounds over classes of signal sequences of length n, allowing for sparsity of various kinds and degrees.   The signal classes considered are ``nearly black'' sequences where only a proportion \eta is allowed to be nonzero, and sequences with normalized \ell_p norm bounded by \eta, for \eta >0 and 0<p\le 2. Estimation error is measured by mean qth power loss, for 0<q\le 2. For all the classes considered, and for all q in (0,2], the method achieves the optimal estimation rate as n\to \infty and \eta \to 0 at various rates, and in this sense adapts automatically to the sparseness or otherwise of the underlying signal. In addition the risk is uniformly bounded over all signals. If the posterior mean is used as the estimator, the results still hold for q>1.

Maximum Fisher information in mixed state quantum systems,Alessandra Luati,1,"We deal with the maximization of classical Fisher information in a quantum system depending on an unknown parameter. This problem has been raised by physicists, who defined [Helstrom (1967) Phys. Lett. A 25 101-102] a quantum counterpart of classical Fisher information, which has been found to constitute an upper bound for classical information itself [Braunstein and Caves (1994) Phys. Rev. Lett. 72 3439-3443]. It has then become of relevant interest among statisticians, who investigated the relations between classical and quantum information and derived a condition for equality in the particular case of two-dimensional pure state systems [Barndorff-Nielsen and Gill (2000) J. Phys. A 33 4481-4490]. In this paper we show that this condition holds even in the more general setting of two-dimensional mixed state systems.

Aggregation for Regression Learning,"Florentina Bunea, Alexandre Tsybakov, Marten Wegkamp",3,"This paper studies statistical aggregation procedures in regression setting. A motivating factor is the existence of many different methods of estimation, leading to possibly competing estimators.   We consider here three different types of aggregation: model selection (MS) aggregation, convex (C) aggregation and linear (L) aggregation. The objective of (MS) is to select the optimal single estimator from the list; that of (C) is to select the optimal convex combination of the given estimators; and that of (L) is to select the optimal linear combination of the given estimators. We are interested in evaluating the rates of convergence of the excess risks of the estimators obtained by these procedures. Our approach is motivated by recent minimax results in Nemirovski (2000) and Tsybakov (2003).   There exist competing aggregation procedures achieving optimal convergence separately for each one of (MS), (C) and (L) cases. Since the bounds in these results are not directly comparable with each other, we suggest an alternative solution. We prove that all the three optimal bounds can be nearly achieved via a single ""universal"" aggregation procedure. We propose such a procedure which consists in mixing of the initial estimators with the weights obtained by penalized least squares. Two different penalities are considered: one of them is related to hard thresholding techniques, the second one is a data dependent $L_1$-type penalty. Consequently, our method can be endorsed by both the proponents of model selection and the advocates of model averaging.",1566,2004,,arXiv Statistics Theory,0,0,0,0,21.5,Statistics Theory,math.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0410214v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0410214v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0410214v1,math/0410214v1
Statistical modeling of causal effects in continuous time,Judith J. Lok,1,"This article studies the estimation of the causal effect of a time-varying treatment on time-to-an-event or on some other continuously distributed outcome. The paper applies to the situation where treatment is repeatedly adapted to time-dependent patient characteristics. The treatment effect cannot be estimated by simply conditioning on these time-dependent patient characteristics, as they may themselves be indications of the treatment effect. This time-dependent confounding is common in observational studies. Robins [(1992) Biometrika 79 321--334, (1998b) Encyclopedia of Biostatistics 6 4372--4389] has proposed the so-called structural nested models to estimate treatment effects in the presence of time-dependent confounding. In this article we provide a conceptual framework and formalization for structural nested models in continuous time. We show that the resulting estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, as conjectured in Robins [(1998b) Encyclopedia of Biostatistics 6 4372--4389], a test for whether treatment affects the outcome of interest can be performed without specifying a model for treatment effect.

At i th step of this procedure an estimate of the location parameters for non-missing components of the vector is based on combining the information in the subset of observations with the non-missing components with updated estimates of the location parameters from all subsets with even more missing components in an iterative fashion. If the variance-covariance matrix is known, then the resulting estimator is unbiased with the smallest variance provided missing data are ignorable. It is also shown that the resulting estimator based on consistent estimators of variance-covariance matrices obtains unbiasedness and the smallest variance asymptotically. This approach can also be extended to some cases of non-ignorable missing data.

It estimates the auto-regressive operator by extending methods of the reduced-rank auto-regression to the functional data. Such an estimation technique is better suited for prediction purposes as opposed to the methods based either on principal components or canonical correlations.

Average treatment effect estimation via random recursive partitioning,"Stefano Iacus, Giuseppe Porro",2,"A new matching method is proposed for the estimation of the average treatment effect of social policy interventions (e.g., training programs or health care measures). Given an outcome variable, a treatment and a set of pre-treatment covariates, the method is based on the examination of random recursive partitions of the space of covariates using regression trees. A regression tree is grown either on the treated or on the untreated individuals {\it only} using as response variable a random permutation of the indexes 1...$n$ ($n$ being the number of units involved), while the indexes for the other group are predicted using this tree. The procedure is replicated in order to rule out the effect of specific permutations. The average treatment effect is estimated in each tree by matching treated and untreated in the same terminal nodes. The final estimator of the average treatment effect is obtained by averaging on all the trees grown. The method does not require any specific model assumption apart from the tree's complexity, which does not affect the estimator though. We show that this method is either an instrument to check whether two samples can be matched (by any method) and, when this is feasible, to obtain reliable estimates of the average treatment effect. We further propose a graphical tool to inspect the quality of the match.

Concerning design of kernel density estimators, one essential issue is how fast the pointwise mean square error (MSE) and/or the integrated mean square error (IMSE) diminish as the number of sampling instances increases.

Bayesian Classification and Regression with High Dimensional Features,Longhai Li,1,"This thesis responds to the challenges of using a large number, such as thousands, of features in regression and classification problems.   There are two situations where such high dimensional features arise. One is when high dimensional measurements are available, for example, gene expression data produced by microarray techniques. For computational or other reasons, people may select only a small subset of features when modelling such data, by looking at how relevant the features are to predicting the response, based on some measure such as correlation with the response in the training data. Although it is used very commonly, this procedure will make the response appear more predictable than it actually is. In Chapter 2, we propose a Bayesian method to avoid this selection bias, with application to naive Bayes models and mixture models.   High dimensional features also arise when we consider high-order interactions. The number of parameters will increase exponentially with the order considered. In Chapter 3, we propose a method for compressing a group of parameters into a single one, by exploiting the fact that many predictor variables derived from high-order interactions have the same values for all the training cases. The number of compressed parameters may have converged before considering the highest possible order. We apply this compression method to logistic sequence prediction models and logistic classification models.

Simulated Annealing: Rigorous finite-time guarantees for optimization on continuous domains,"A. Lecchini-Visintini, J. Lygeros, J.

Given a corpus of documents, a posterior inference algorithm finds an approximation to a posterior distribution over trees, topics and allocations of words to levels of the tree.

Pac-Bayesian Supervised Classification: The Thermodynamics of Statistical Learning,Olivier Catoni,1,"This monograph deals with adaptive supervised classification, using tools borrowed from statistical mechanics and information theory, stemming from the PACBayesian approach pioneered by David McAllester and applied to a conception of statistical learning theory forged by Vladimir Vapnik.

We then discuss relative bounds, comparing the generalization error of two classification rules, showing how the margin assumption of Mammen and Tsybakov can be replaced with some empirical measure of the covariance structure of the classification model.We show how to associate to any posterior distribution an effective temperature relating it to the Gibbs prior distribution with the same level of expected error rate, and how to estimate this effective temperature from data, resulting in an estimator whose expected error rate converges according to the best possible power of the sample size adaptively under any margin and parametric complexity assumptions. We describe and study an alternative selection scheme based on relative bounds between estimators, and present a two step localization technique which can handle the selection of a parametric model from a family of those. We show how to extend systematically all the results obtained in the inductive setting to transductive learning, and use this to improve Vapnik's generalization bounds, extending them to the case when the sample is made of independent non-identically distributed pairs of patterns and labels.

By only viewing a series of 2-dimensional projections, the high-dimensional nature of the data is rarely exploited. In this paper we present a means of determining a low-dimensional projection which maintains the high-dimensional relationships (i.e. information) between differing oncological data sets. By using machine learning techniques, we allow clinicians to visualize data in a low dimension defined by a linear combination of all of the available markers, rather than just 2 at a time. This provides an aid in diagnosing similar forms of cancer, as well as a means for variable selection in exploratory flow cytometric research. We refer to our method as Information Preserving Component Analysis (IPCA).",1218,2008,,arXiv Statistical Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,17.5,Statistical Machine Learning,stat.ML,https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2848v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.2848v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2848v1,0804.2848v1

The measure also serves as a natural tool when choosing dimension-reduction parameters.

Supervised functional classification: A theoretical remark and some comparisons,"Amparo Baillo, Antonio Cuevas",2,"The problem of supervised classification (or discrimination) with functional data is considered, with a special interest on the popular k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier. First, relying on a recent result by Cerou and Guyader (2006), we prove the consistency of the k-NN classifier for functional data whose distribution belongs to a broad family of Gaussian processes with triangular covariance functions. Second, on a more practical side, we check the behavior of the k-NN method when compared with a few other functional classifiers. This is carried out through a small simulation study and the analysis of several real functional data sets. While no global ""uniform"" winner emerges from such comparisons, the overall performance of the k-NN method, together with its sound intuitive motivation and relative simplicity, suggests that it could represent a reasonable benchmark for the classification problem with functional data.",935,2008,,arXiv Statistical Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,17.5,Statistical Machine Learning,stat.ML,https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2831v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.2831v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2831v1,0806.2831v1

LLE with low-dimensional neighborhood representation,"Yair Goldberg, Ya'acov Ritov",2,"The local linear embedding algorithm (LLE) is a non-linear dimension-reducing technique, widely used due to its computational simplicity and intuitive approach. LLE first linearly reconstructs each input point from its nearest neighbors and then preserves these neighborhood relations in the low-dimensional embedding. We show that the reconstruction weights computed by LLE capture the high-dimensional structure of the neighborhoods, and not the low-dimensional manifold structure. Consequently, the weight vectors are highly sensitive to noise. Moreover, this causes LLE to converge to a linear projection of the input, as opposed to its non-linear embedding goal. To overcome both of these problems, we propose to compute the weight vectors using a low-dimensional neighborhood representation. We prove theoretically that this straightforward and computationally simple modification of LLE reduces LLE's sensitivity to noise. This modification also removes the need for regularization when the number of neighbors is larger than the dimension of the input.

We show how higher-order Bayesian decision-making problems, such as optimizing image acquisition in magnetic resonance scanners, can be addressed by querying the SLM posterior covariance, unrelated to the density's mode. We propose a scalable algorithmic framework, with which SLM posteriors over full, high-resolution images can be approximated for the first time, solving a variational optimization problem which is convex iff posterior mode finding is convex.

It is however unclear if these heuristics can be derived from a more general principle facilitating generalization to new problem settings. Motivated by an existing graph partitioning framework, we derive relationships between optimizing relevance information, as defined in the Information Bottleneck method, and the regularized cut in a K-partitioned graph. For fast mixing graphs, we show that the cost functions introduced by Shi and Malik can be well approximated as the rate of loss of predictive information about the location of random walkers on the graph.

First we consider the closure of $k$-dimensional exponential families of distribution with discrete base measure and polyhedral convex support $\mathrm{P}$. We show that the normal fan of $\mathrm{P}$ is a geometric object that plays a fundamental role in deriving the statistical and geometric properties of the corresponding extended exponential families.

Reconstruction of Epsilon-Machines in Predictive Frameworks and Decisional States,Nicolas Brodu,1,"This article introduces both a new algorithm for reconstructing epsilon-machines from data, as well as the decisional states. These are defined as the internal states of a system that lead to the same decision, based on a user-provided utility or pay-off function. The utility function encodes some a priori knowledge external to the system, it quantifies how bad it is to make mistakes. The intrinsic underlying structure of the system is modeled by an epsilon-machine and its causal states. The decisional states form a partition of the lower-level causal states that is defined according to the higher-level user's knowledge. In a complex systems perspective, the decisional states are thus the ""emerging"" patterns corresponding to the utility function. The transitions between these decisional states correspond to events that lead to a change of decision.

Finding Exogenous Variables in Data with Many More Variables than Observations,"Shohei Shimizu, Takashi Washio, Aapo Hyvarinen, Seiya Imoto",4,"Many statistical methods have been proposed to estimate causal models in classical situations with fewer variables than observations (p<n, p: the number of variables and n: the number of observations). However, modern datasets including gene expression data need high-dimensional causal modeling in challenging situations with orders of magnitude more variables than observations (p>>n). In this paper, we propose a method to find exogenous variables in a linear non-Gaussian causal model, which requires much smaller sample sizes than conventional methods and works even when p>>n. The key idea is to identify which variables are exogenous based on non-Gaussianity instead of estimating the entire structure of the model. Exogenous variables work as triggers that activate a causal chain in the model, and their identification leads to more efficient experimental designs and better understanding of the causal mechanism.

Forest Garrote,Nicolai Meinshausen,1,"Variable selection for high-dimensional linear models has received a lot of attention lately, mostly in the context of l1-regularization. Part of the attraction is the variable selection effect: parsimonious models are obtained, which are very suitable for interpretation. In terms of predictive power, however, these regularized linear models are often slightly inferior to machine learning procedures like tree ensembles. Tree ensembles, on the other hand, lack usually a formal way of variable selection and are difficult to visualize. A Garrote-style convex penalty for trees ensembles, in particular Random Forests, is proposed. The penalty selects functional groups of nodes in the trees. These could be as simple as monotone functions of individual predictor variables. This yields a parsimonious function fit, which lends itself easily to visualization and interpretation.

The Feature Importance Ranking Measure,"Alexander Zien, Nicole Kraemer, Soeren Sonnenburg, Gunnar Raetsch",4,"Most accurate predictions are typically obtained by learning machines with complex feature spaces (as e.g. induced by kernels). Unfortunately, such decision rules are hardly accessible to humans and cannot easily be used to gain insights about the application domain. Therefore, one often resorts to linear models in combination with variable selection, thereby sacrificing some predictive power for presumptive interpretability. Here, we introduce the Feature Importance Ranking Measure (FIRM), which by retrospective analysis of arbitrary learning machines allows to achieve both excellent predictive performance and superior interpretation. In contrast to standard raw feature weighting, FIRM takes the underlying correlation structure of the features into account. Thereby, it is able to discover the most relevant features, even if their appearance in the training data is entirely prevented by noise. The desirable properties of FIRM are investigated analytically and illustrated in simulations.",1001,2009,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Machine Learning and

KNIFE: Kernel Iterative Feature Extraction,Genevera I. Allen,1,"Selecting important features in non-linear or kernel spaces is a difficult challenge in both classification and regression problems. When many of the features are irrelevant, kernel methods such as the support vector machine and kernel ridge regression can sometimes perform poorly. We propose weighting the features within a kernel with a sparse set of weights that are estimated in conjunction with the original classification or regression problem. The iterative algorithm, KNIFE, alternates between finding the coefficients of the original problem and finding the feature weights through kernel linearization. In addition, a slight modification of KNIFE yields an efficient algorithm for finding feature regularization paths, or the paths of each feature's weight. Simulation results demonstrate the utility of KNIFE for both kernel regression and support vector machines with a variety of kernels. Feature path realizations also reveal important non-linear correlations among features that prove useful in determining a subset of significant variables.

We give conditions under which sample variance penalization is effective. In particular, we present a bound on the excess risk incurred by the method. Using this, we argue that there are situations in which the excess risk of our method is of order 1/n, while the excess risk of empirical risk minimization is of order 1/sqrt/{n}.

Mean-Field Theory of Meta-Learning,Dariusz Plewczynski,1,"We discuss here the mean-field theory for a cellular automata model of meta-learning. The meta-learning is the process of combining outcomes of individual learning procedures in order to determine the final decision with higher accuracy than any single learning method. Our method is constructed from an ensemble of interacting, learning agents, that acquire and process incoming information using various types, or different versions of machine learning algorithms. The abstract learning space, where all agents are located, is constructed here using a fully connected model that couples all agents with random strength values. The cellular automata network simulates the higher level integration of information acquired from the independent learning trials. The final classification of incoming input data is therefore defined as the stationary state of the meta-learning system using simple majority rule, yet the minority clusters that share opposite classification outcome can be observed in the system. Therefore, the probability of selecting proper class for a given input data, can be estimated even without the prior knowledge of its affiliation. The fuzzy logic can be easily introduced into the system, even if learning agents are build from simple binary classification machine learning algorithms by calculating the percentage of agreeing agents.",1359,2009,,arXiv Statistical Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,16.5,Statistical Machine Learning,stat.ML,https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4643v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.4643v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4643v2,0907.4643v2

Classification by Set Cover: The Prototype Vector Machine,"Jacob Bien, Robert Tibshirani",2,"We introduce a new nearest-prototype classifier, the prototype vector machine (PVM). It arises from a combinatorial optimization problem which we cast as a variant of the set cover problem. We propose two algorithms for approximating its solution. The PVM selects a relatively small number of representative points which can then be used for classification. It contains 1-NN as a special case. The method is compatible with any dissimilarity measure, making it amenable to situations in which the data are not embedded in an underlying feature space or in which using a non-Euclidean metric is desirable. Indeed, we demonstrate on the much studied ZIP code data how the PVM can reap the benefits of a problem-specific metric. In this example, the PVM outperforms the highly successful 1-NN with tangent distance, and does so retaining fewer than half of the data points. This example highlights the strengths of the PVM in yielding a low-error, highly interpretable model. Additionally, we apply the PVM to a protein classification problem in which a kernel-based distance is used.",1081,2009,,arXiv Statistical Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,16.5,Statistical Machine Learning,stat.ML,https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2284v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.2284v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2284v1,0908.2284v1

We first cover the case where $\Xcal$ is Euclidian, and focus on kernels which take into account the variance matrix of the mixture of two measures to compute their similarity. The kernels we define are semigroup kernels in the sense that they only use the sum of two measures to compare them, and spectral in the sense that they only use the eigenspectrum of the variance matrix of this mixture. We show that such a family of kernels has close bonds with the laplace transforms of nonnegative-valued functions defined on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices, and we present some closed formulas that can be derived as special cases of such integral expressions. By focusing further on functions which are invariant to the addition of a null eigenvalue to the spectrum of the variance matrix, we can define kernels between atomic measures on arbitrary spaces $\Xcal$ endowed with a kernel $\kappa$ by using directly the eigenvalues of the centered Gram matrix of the joined support of the compared measures.

Initialization Free Graph Based Clustering,"Laurent Galluccio, Olivier J. J. Michel, Pierre Comon, Eric Slezak, Alfred O. Hero",5,"This paper proposes an original approach to cluster multi-component data sets, including an estimation of the number of clusters. From the construction of a minimal spanning tree with Prim's algorithm, and the assumption that the vertices are approximately distributed according to a Poisson distribution, the number of clusters is estimated by thresholding the Prim's trajectory. The corresponding cluster centroids are then computed in order to initialize the generalized Lloyd's algorithm, also known as $K$-means, which allows to circumvent initialization problems. Some results are derived for evaluating the false positive rate of our cluster detection algorithm, with the help of approximations relevant in Euclidean spaces. Metrics used for measuring similarity between multi-dimensional data points are based on symmetrical divergences. The use of these informational divergences together with the proposed method leads to better results, compared to other clustering methods for the problem of astrophysical data processing. Some applications of this method in the multi/hyper-spectral imagery domain to a satellite view of Paris and to an image of the Mars planet are also presented.

Laplacian Support Vector Machines Trained in the Primal,"Stefano Melacci, Mikhail Belkin",2,"In the last few years, due to the growing ubiquity of unlabeled data, much effort has been spent by the machine learning community to develop better understanding and improve the quality of classifiers exploiting unlabeled data. Following the manifold regularization approach, Laplacian Support Vector Machines (LapSVMs) have shown the state of the art performance in semi--supervised classification. In this paper we present two strategies to solve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the original dual formulation. Whereas training a LapSVM in the dual requires two steps, using the primal form allows us to collapse training to a single step. Moreover, the computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced from O(n^3) to O(n^2) using preconditioned conjugate gradient, where n is the combined number of labeled and unlabeled examples. We speed up training by using an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or, if available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to quickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classification accuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. Due to its simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for additional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for dealing with large datasets.

Functional learning through kernels,"Stephane Canu, Xavier Mary, Alain Rakotomamonjy",3,"This paper reviews the functional aspects of statistical learning theory. The main point under consideration is the nature of the hypothesis set when no prior information is available but data. Within this framework we first discuss about the hypothesis set: it is a vectorial space, it is a set of pointwise defined functions, and the evaluation functional on this set is a continuous mapping. Based on these principles an original theory is developed generalizing the notion of reproduction kernel Hilbert space to non hilbertian sets. Then it is shown that the hypothesis set of any learning machine has to be a generalized reproducing set. Therefore, thanks to a general ""representer theorem"", the solution of the learning problem is still a linear combination of a kernel. Furthermore, a way to design these kernels is given. To illustrate this framework some examples of such reproducing sets and kernels are given.",921,2009,"Advances in Learning Theory: Methods, Models and Application, J.

We derive a well-principled set of codes for both parameters and error residuals along with smooth approximations to lengths of these codes as to allow gradient descent optimization of description length, and go on to show that sparsification and feature selection using our approach is faster than the LASSO on several datasets from the UCI and StatLib repositories, with favorable generalization accuracy, while being fully automatic, requiring neither cross-validation nor tuning of regularization hyper-parameters, allowing even for a nonlinear expansion of the feature set followed by sparsification.",1036,2009,,arXiv Statistical Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,16.5,Statistical Machine Learning,stat.ML,https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4135v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.4135v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4135v1,0910.4135v1
Distinguishing Cause and Effect via Second Order Exponential Models,"Dominik Janzing, Xiaohai Sun, Bernhard Schoelkopf",3,"We propose a method to infer causal structures containing both discrete and continuous variables. The idea is to select causal hypotheses for which the conditional density of every variable, given its causes, becomes smooth. We define a family of smooth densities and conditional densities by second order exponential models, i.e., by maximizing conditional entropy subject to first and second statistical moments. If some of the variables take only values in proper subsets of R^n, these conditionals can induce different families of joint distributions even for Markov-equivalent graphs.   We consider the case of one binary and one real-valued variable where the method can distinguish between cause and effect. Using this example, we describe that sometimes a causal hypothesis must be rejected because P(effect|cause) and P(cause) share algorithmic information (which is untypical if they are chosen independently). This way, our method is in the same spirit as faithfulness-based causal inference because it also rejects non-generic mutual adjustments among DAG-parameters.",1079,2009,,arXiv Statistical Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,16.5,Statistical Machine Learning,stat.ML,https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5561v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.5561v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5561v1,0910.5561v1
Causal Inference on Discrete Data using Additive Noise Models,"Jonas Peters, Dominik Janzing, Bernhard Schölkopf",3,"Inferring the causal structure of a set of random variables from a finite sample of the joint distribution is an important problem in science. Recently, methods using additive noise models have been suggested to approach the case of continuous variables. In many situations, however, the variables of interest are discrete or even have only finitely many states. In this work we extend the notion of additive noise models to these cases. We prove that whenever the joint distribution $\prob^{(X,Y)}$ admits such a model in one direction, e.g. $Y=f(X)+N, N \independent X$, it does not admit the reversed model $X=g(Y)+\tilde N, \tilde N \independent Y$ as long as the model is chosen in a generic way.

How slow is slow? SFA detects signals that are slower than the driving force,"Wolfgang Konen, Patrick Koch",2,"Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a method for extracting slowly varying driving forces from quickly varying nonstationary time series. We show here that it is possible for SFA to detect a component which is even slower than the driving force itself (e.g. the envelope of a modulated sine wave). It is shown that it depends on circumstances like the embedding dimension, the time series predictability, or the base frequency, whether the driving force itself or a slower subcomponent is detected. We observe a phase transition from one regime to the other and it is the purpose of this work to quantify the influence of various parameters on this phase transition.

Sparse Convolved Multiple Output Gaussian Processes,"Mauricio A. Álvarez, Neil D. Lawrence",2,"Recently there has been an increasing interest in methods that deal with multiple outputs. This has been motivated partly by frameworks like multitask learning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From a Gaussian processes perspective, the problem reduces to specifying an appropriate covariance function that, whilst being positive semi-definite, captures the dependencies between all the data points and across all the outputs. One approach to account for non-trivial correlations between outputs employs convolution processes. Under a latent function interpretation of the convolution transform we establish dependencies between output variables. The main drawbacks of this approach are the associated computational and storage demands. In this paper we address these issues. We present different sparse approximations for dependent output Gaussian processes constructed through the convolution formalism. We exploit the conditional independencies present naturally in the model. This leads to a form of the covariance similar in spirit to the so called PITC and FITC approximations for a single output.

Under-determined reverberant audio source separation using a full-rank spatial covariance model,"Ngoc Duong, Emmanuel Vincent, Remi Gribonval",3,"This article addresses the modeling of reverberant recording environments in the context of under-determined convolutive blind source separation. We model the contribution of each source to all mixture channels in the time-frequency domain as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable whose covariance encodes the spatial characteristics of the source. We then consider four specific covariance models, including a full-rank unconstrained model. We derive a family of iterative expectationmaximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the parameters of each model and propose suitable procedures to initialize the parameters and to align the order of the estimated sources across all frequency bins based on their estimated directions of arrival (DOA).

Hyper-sparse optimal aggregation,"Stéphane Gaïffas, Guillaume Lecué",2,"In this paper, we consider the problem of ""hyper-sparse aggregation"". Namely, given a dictionary $F = \{f_1, ..., f_M \}$ of functions, we look for an optimal aggregation algorithm that writes $\tilde f = \sum_{j=1}^M \theta_j f_j$ with as many zero coefficients $\theta_j$ as possible. This problem is of particular interest when $F$ contains many irrelevant functions that should not appear in $\tilde{f}$. We provide an exact oracle inequality for $\tilde f$, where only two coefficients are non-zero, that entails $\tilde f$ to be an optimal aggregation algorithm. Since selectors are suboptimal aggregation procedures, this proves that 2 is the minimal number of elements of $F$ required for the construction of an optimal aggregation procedures in every situations. A simulated example of this algorithm is proposed on a dictionary obtained using LARS, for the problem of selection of the regularization parameter of the LASSO. We also give an example of use of aggregation to achieve minimax adaptation over anisotropic Besov spaces, which was not previously known in minimax theory (in regression on a random design).",1125,2009,,arXiv Statistical Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,16.5,Statistical Machine Learning,stat.ML,https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1618v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.1618v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1618v1,0912.1618v1

Variational Inducing Kernels for Sparse Convolved Multiple Output Gaussian Processes,"Mauricio A. Álvarez, David Luengo, Michalis K. Titsias, Neil D. Lawrence",4,"Interest in multioutput kernel methods is increasing, whether under the guise of multitask learning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From the Gaussian process perspective a multioutput Mercer kernel is a covariance function over correlated output functions. One way of constructing such kernels is based on convolution processes (CP). A key problem for this approach is efficient inference. Alvarez and Lawrence (2009) recently presented a sparse approximation for CPs that enabled efficient inference. In this paper, we extend this work in two directions: we introduce the concept of variational inducing functions to handle potential non-smooth functions involved in the kernel CP construction and we consider an alternative approach to approximate inference based on variational methods, extending the work by Titsias (2009) to the multiple output case.

We also consider the question of the ``best'' surrogate binary loss. We introduce a precise notion of ``best'' and show there exist situations where two convex surrogate losses are incommensurable. We provide a complete explicit characterisation of the convexity of composite binary losses in terms of the link function and the weight function associated with the proper loss which make up the composite loss. This characterisation suggests new ways of ``surrogate tuning''.

Learning the Structure of Deep Sparse Graphical Models,"Ryan Prescott Adams, Hanna M. Wallach, Zoubin Ghahramani",3,"Deep belief networks are a powerful way to model complex probability distributions. However, learning the structure of a belief network, particularly one with hidden units, is difficult. The Indian buffet process has been used as a nonparametric Bayesian prior on the directed structure of a belief network with a single infinitely wide hidden layer. In this paper, we introduce the cascading Indian buffet process (CIBP), which provides a nonparametric prior on the structure of a layered, directed belief network that is unbounded in both depth and width, yet allows tractable inference. We use the CIBP prior with the nonlinear Gaussian belief network so each unit can additionally vary its behavior between discrete and continuous representations.

For density estimation, we do not assume the true distribution corresponds to a forest; rather, we form kernel density estimates of the bivariate and univariate marginals, and apply Kruskal's algorithm to estimate the optimal forest on held out data. We prove an oracle inequality on the excess risk of the resulting estimator relative to the risk of the best forest. For graph estimation, we consider the problem of estimating forests with restricted tree sizes. We prove that finding a maximum weight spanning forest with restricted tree size is NP-hard, and develop an approximation algorithm for this problem. Viewing the tree size as a complexity parameter, we then select a forest using data splitting, and prove bounds on excess risk and structure selection consistency of the procedure.

Probabilistic Recovery of Multiple Subspaces in Point Clouds by Geometric lp Minimization,"Gilad Lerman, Teng Zhang",2,"We assume data independently sampled from a mixture distribution on the unit ball of the D-dimensional Euclidean space with K+1 components: the first component is a uniform distribution on that ball representing outliers and the other K components are uniform distributions along K d-dimensional linear subspaces restricted to that ball. We study both the simultaneous recovery of all K underlying subspaces and the recovery of the best l0 subspace (i.e., with largest number of points) by minimizing the lp-averaged distances of data points from d-dimensional subspaces of the D-dimensional space. Unlike other lp minimization problems, this minimization is non-convex for all p>0 and thus requires different methods for its analysis. We show that if 0<p <= 1, then both all underlying subspaces and the best l0 subspace can be precisely recovered by lp minimization with overwhelming probability. This result extends to additive homoscedastic uniform noise around the subspaces (i.e., uniform distribution in a strip around them) and near recovery with an error proportional to the noise level. On the other hand, if K>1 and p>1, then we show that both all underlying subspaces and the best l0 subspace cannot be recovered and even nearly recovered. Further relaxations are also discussed. We use the results of this paper for partially justifying recent effective algorithms for modeling data by mixtures of multiple subspaces as well as for discussing the effect of using variants of lp minimizations in RANSAC-type strategies for single subspace recovery.",1560,2010,,arXiv Statistical Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,15.5,Statistical Machine Learning,stat.ML,https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1994v3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.1994v3.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1994v3,1002.1994v3
Robust Independent Component Analysis by Iterative Maximization of the Kurtosis Contrast with Algebraic Optimal Step Size,"Vicente Zarzoso, Pierre Comon",2,"Independent component analysis (ICA) aims at decomposing an observed random vector into statistically independent variables. Deflation-based implementations, such as the popular one-unit FastICA algorithm and its variants, extract the independent components one after another. A novel method for deflationary ICA, referred to as RobustICA, is put forward in this paper. This simple technique consists of performing exact line search optimization of the kurtosis contrast function. The step size leading to the global maximum of the contrast along the search direction is found among the roots of a fourth-degree polynomial. This polynomial rooting can be performed algebraically, and thus at low cost, at each iteration. Among other practical benefits, RobustICA can avoid prewhitening and deals with real- and complex-valued mixtures of possibly noncircular sources alike. The absence of prewhitening improves asymptotic performance. The algorithm is robust to local extrema and shows a very high convergence speed in terms of the computational cost required to reach a given source extraction quality, particularly for short data records. These features are demonstrated by a comparative numerical analysis on synthetic data. RobustICA's capabilities in processing real-world data involving noncircular complex strongly super-Gaussian sources are illustrated by the biomedical problem of atrial activity (AA) extraction in atrial fibrillation (AF) electrocardiograms (ECGs), where it outperforms an alternative ICA-based technique.",1533,2010,"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 21, 2 (2010) 248-261",arXiv Statistical Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,15.5,Statistical Machine Learning,stat.ML,https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3684v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.3684v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3684v1,1002.3684v1
Security Analysis of Online Centroid Anomaly Detection,"Marius Kloft, Pavel Laskov",2,"Security issues are crucial in a number of machine learning applications, especially in scenarios dealing with human activity rather than natural phenomena (e.g., information ranking, spam detection, malware detection, etc.). It is to be expected in such cases that learning algorithms will have to deal with manipulated data aimed at hampering decision making. Although some previous work addressed the handling of malicious data in the context of supervised learning, very little is known about the behavior of anomaly detection methods in such scenarios. In this contribution we analyze the performance of a particular method -- online centroid anomaly detection -- in the presence of adversarial noise. Our analysis addresses the following security-related issues: formalization of learning and attack processes, derivation of an optimal attack, analysis of its efficiency and constraints. We derive bounds on the effectiveness of a poisoning attack against centroid anomaly under different conditions: bounded and unbounded percentage of traffic, and bounded false positive rate. Our bounds show that whereas a poisoning attack can be effectively staged in the unconstrained case, it can be made arbitrarily difficult (a strict upper bound on the attacker's gain) if external constraints are properly used. Our experimental evaluation carried out on real HTTP and exploit traces confirms the tightness of our theoretical bounds and practicality of our protection mechanisms.",1479,2010,,arXiv Statistical Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,15.5,Statistical Machine Learning,stat.ML,https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0078v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.0078v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0078v1,1003.0078v1

The algorithm, which we call greedy RLS, starts from the empty feature set, and on each iteration adds the feature whose addition provides the best leave-one-out cross-validation performance. Our method is considerably faster than the previously proposed ones, since its time complexity is linear in the number of training examples, the number of features in the original data set, and the desired size of the set of selected features. Therefore, as a side effect we obtain a new training algorithm for learning sparse linear RLS predictors which can be used for large scale learning. This speed is possible due to matrix calculus based short-cuts for leave-one-out and feature addition.

Sparse Linear Identifiable Multivariate Modeling,"Ricardo Henao, Ole Winther",2,"In this paper we consider sparse and identifiable linear latent variable (factor) and linear Bayesian network models for parsimonious analysis of multivariate data. We propose a computationally efficient method for joint parameter and model inference, and model comparison. It consists of a fully Bayesian hierarchy for sparse models using slab and spike priors (two-component delta-function and continuous mixtures), non-Gaussian latent factors and a stochastic search over the ordering of the variables. The framework, which we call SLIM (Sparse Linear Identifiable Multivariate modeling), is validated and bench-marked on artificial and real biological data sets. SLIM is closest in spirit to LiNGAM (Shimizu et al., 2006), but differs substantially in inference, Bayesian network structure learning and model comparison. Experimentally, SLIM performs equally well or better than LiNGAM with comparable computational complexity. We attribute this mainly to the stochastic search strategy used, and to parsimony (sparsity and identifiability), which is an explicit part of the model. We propose two extensions to the basic i.i.d. linear framework: non-linear dependence on observed variables, called SNIM (Sparse Non-linear Identifiable Multivariate modeling) and allowing for correlations between latent variables, called CSLIM (Correlated SLIM), for the temporal and/or spatial data.

Here, working directly with the distributions of the random distances rather than resorting to the moment generating function technique, an improvement on the lower bound for $k$ is obtained. The additional reduction in dimension when compared to bounds found in the literature, is at least $13\%$, and, in some cases, up to $30\%$ additional reduction is achieved. Using the moment generating function technique, we further provide a lower bound for $k$ using pairwise $L_2$ distances in the space of points to be projected and pairwise $L_1$ distances in the space of the projected points.

Stability Approach to Regularization Selection (StARS) for High Dimensional Graphical Models,"Han Liu, Kathryn Roeder, Larry Wasserman",3,"A challenging problem in estimating high-dimensional graphical models is to choose the regularization parameter in a data-dependent way. The standard techniques include $K$-fold cross-validation ($K$-CV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including $K$-CV, AIC, and BIC, on both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset.

The GPLVM consists of a set of points in a low dimensional latent space, and a stochastic map to the observed space. We show how it can be interpreted as a density model in the observed space. However, the GPLVM is not trained as a density model and therefore yields bad density estimates.

Directional Statistics on Permutations,"Sergey M. Plis, Terran Lane, Vince D. Calhoun",3,"Distributions over permutations arise in applications ranging from multi-object tracking to ranking of instances. The difficulty of dealing with these distributions is caused by the size of their domain, which is factorial in the number of considered entities ($n!$). It makes the direct definition of a multinomial distribution over permutation space impractical for all but a very small $n$. In this work we propose an embedding of all $n!$ permutations for a given $n$ in a surface of a hypersphere defined in $\mathbbm{R}^{(n-1)^2}$. As a result of the embedding, we acquire ability to define continuous distributions over a hypersphere with all the benefits of directional statistics. We provide polynomial time projections between the continuous hypersphere representation and the $n!$-element permutation space. The framework provides a way to use continuous directional probability densities and the methods developed thereof for establishing densities over permutations. As a demonstration of the benefits of the framework we derive an inference procedure for a state-space model over permutations. We demonstrate the approach with applications.",1154,2010,,arXiv Statistical Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,15.5,Statistical Machine Learning,stat.ML,https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2450v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.2450v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2450v1,1007.2450v1
Reduced Rank Vector Generalized Linear Models for Feature Extraction,Yiyuan She,1,"Supervised linear feature extraction can be achieved by fitting a reduced rank multivariate model. This paper studies rank penalized and rank constrained vector generalized linear models. From the perspective of thresholding rules, we build a framework for fitting singular value penalized models and use it for feature extraction. Through solving the rank constraint form of the problem, we propose progressive feature space reduction for fast computation in high dimensions with little performance loss. A novel projective cross-validation is proposed for parameter tuning in such nonconvex setups.

Support Vector Machines for Additive Models: Consistency and Robustness,"Andreas Christmann, Robert Hable",2,"Support vector machines (SVMs) are special kernel based methods and belong to the most successful learning methods since more than a decade. SVMs can informally be described as a kind of regularized M-estimators for functions and have demonstrated their usefulness in many complicated real-life problems. During the last years a great part of the statistical research on SVMs has concentrated on the question how to design SVMs such that they are universally consistent and statistically robust for nonparametric classification or nonparametric regression purposes. In many applications, some qualitative prior knowledge of the distribution P or of the unknown function f to be estimated is present or the prediction function with a good interpretability is desired, such that a semiparametric model or an additive model is of interest.   In this paper we mainly address the question how to design SVMs by choosing the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) or its corresponding kernel to obtain consistent and statistically robust estimators in additive models. We give an explicit construction of kernels - and thus of their RKHSs - which leads in combination with a Lipschitz continuous loss function to consistent and statistically robust SMVs for additive models. Examples are quantile regression based on the pinball loss function, regression based on the epsilon-insensitive loss function, and classification based on the hinge loss function.",1450,2010,,arXiv Statistical Machine Learning,0,0,0,0,15.5,Statistical Machine Learning,stat.ML,https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.4062v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.4062v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.4062v1,1007.4062v1
Gamma-Ray Bursts as the Death Throes of Massive Binary Stars,"Ramesh Narayan, Bohdan Paczyński, Tsvi Piran",3,"It is proposed that gamma-ray bursts are created in the mergers of double neutron star binaries and black hole neutron star binaries at cosmological distances. Bursts with complex profiles and relatively long durations are the result of magnetic flares generated by the Parker instability in a post-merger differentially-rotating disk. Some bursts may also be produced through neutrino-antineutrino annihilation into electrons and positrons. In both cases, an optically thick fireball of size $\sles\ 100$ km is initially created, which expands ultrarelativistically to large radii before radiating. Several previous objections to the cosmological merger model are eliminated. It is predicted that $\gamma$-ray bursts will be accompanied by a burst of gravitational radiation from the spiraling-in binary which could be detected by LIGO.",837,1992,Astrophys.J. 395 (1992) L83-L86,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,33.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9204001v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9204001v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9204001v1,astro-ph/9204001v1
Gravitational Lensing and the Variability of G,"Lawrence Krauss, Martin White",2,"The four observables associated with gravitational lensing of distant quasars by intervening galaxies: image splittings, relative amplifications, time delays, and optical depths, provide separate measures of the strength of the gravitational constant $G$ at cosmological distances. These allow one, in principle, to factor out unknown lensing parameters to directly to probe the variation of $G$ over cosmological time. We estimate constraints on $\dot{G}$ which may be derivable by this method both now and in the future. The limits one may obtain can compete or exceed other direct limits on $\dot{G}$ today, but unfortunately extracting this information, is not independent of the effort to fix other cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\Omega_0$ from lensing observations.",783,1992,"Astrophys.J.397:357,1992",arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,33.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9204002v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9204002v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9204002v1,astro-ph/9204002v1
The Ptolemaic Gamma-Ray Burst Universe,J. I. Katz,1,"The BATSE experiment on GRO has demonstrated the isotropic arrival directions and flat $\log N$ {\it vs.} $\log S$ of cosmic gamma-ray bursts. These data are best explained if the burst sources are distributed throughout an extended spherical Galactic halo, as previously suggested by Jennings. The halo's radius is at least 40 Kpc, and probably is more than 100 Kpc. I consider possible origins of this halo, including primordial formation and neutron stars recoiling from their birthplaces in the Galactic disc. A simple geometrical model leads to a predicted relation between the dipole and quadrupole anisotropy. I suggest that neutron stars born with low recoil become millisecond pulsars, while those born with high recoil become the sources of gamma-ray bursts; these populations are nearly disjoint.

Expanding Photospheres of Type II Supernovae and the Extragalactic Distance Scale,"B P Schmidt, R P Kirshner, R G Eastman",3,"We use the Expanding Photosphere Method to determine distances to 10 type II supernovae. The effects of asymmetries, extinction, and flux dilution are explored. Using empirical evidence and time-independent, spherical models which treat H and He in non-LTE, we show that blackbody corrections caused by flux dilution are small for type II supernovae in the infrared, and in the optical when their color temperatures are less than 6000~K. The extinction to a type II-P supernova can be estimated from its light curve: the uncertainty introduced into a distance measurement due to extinction is usually less than 10\%. Correcting for extinction and flux dilution we derive distances to 10 supernovae: SN 1968L, SN 1969L, SN 1970G, SN 1973R, SN 1979C, SN 1980K, SN 1987A, SN 1988A, SN 1990E, and SN 1990ae. The distance measurements span a wide range, 50 kpc to 120 Mpc, which is unique among the methods for establishing the extragalactic distance scale. The distances measured to SN 1970G in M101 and SN 1987A in the LMC are in good agreement with distances determined from Cepheid variable stars. Our distance to the Virgo Cluster, 22 +- 3 Mpc, is larger than recent distances estimates made using surface brightness fluctuations, planetary nebula luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher method. Using the distances determined from these type II supernovae we derive a value of $H_0 = 60 \pm 10$ km sec$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is subject to errors caused by local deviations in the Hubble flow, but will soon be improved by applying the Expanding Photosphere Method to several distant type II supernovae.",1612,1992,Astrophys.J. 395 (1992) 366-386,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,33.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9204004v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9204004v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9204004v1,astro-ph/9204004v1
Radiation Transfer in Gamma-Ray Bursts,"B. J. Carrigan, J. I. Katz",2,"We have calculated gamma-ray radiative transport in regions of high energy density, such as gamma-ray burst source regions, using a discrete ordinate, discrete energy group method. The calculations include two-photon pair production and annihilation, as well as three-photon pair annihilation. The radiation field itself acts as an absorbing medium, and the optical depth depends on its intensity, so the problem is intrinsically nonlinear. Spherical divergence produces effective collimation of the flux. At high optical depth the high energy ($E > 1$ MeV) portion of the emergent spectrum assumes a nearly universal form. An approximate limit is derived for the high energy flux from a gamma-ray burst source region of given size, and the implications of this limit for the distance to the March 5, 1979 event are briefly discussed.

The grain temperature is determined by the diluted nova radiation field rather than the gas kinetic temperature, making classical nucleation theory inapplicable. We used kinetic equations to calculate the growth of carbon nuclei in these ejecta. For expected values of the parameters too many clusters grew, despite the small sticking probability of atoms to small clusters, and the clusters only reached radii of about 100\AA\ when the carbon vapor was depleted. We then included the effects of cluster photodissociation by ultraviolet radiation from the nova. This suppresses nucleation, but too well, and no grains form at all.

The growth rate of the short wavelength modes is greatly reduced when the gradient in the magnetic field direction exceeds 0.5 radian per scale height.

For our models, we adopt a supernova rate of 0.1 ${\rm yr}^{-1}$, and an extended low-density static halo that is bound to the galaxy. There are three stages to the evolution of the wind-blown bubble and the propagation of the shock front: the bubble expands in an almost uniform density disk gas, with a deceleration of the shock front ($t \alt $ 3.6 Myr); breakout from the disk and the upward acceleration of the shock front (3.6   Myr $\alt t \alt$ 18 Myr); propagation into the halo, leading to a more spherical system and shock deceleration (18 Myr $\alt t$). For a halo density of $10^{-3} {\rm cm}^{-3}$, the outflow reaches a distance of 40-50 kpc from the center of the starburst galaxy in 50 Myr.

Mateo",3,"In this paper we have examined the age and internal dynamics of the young binary LMC cluster NGC 1850 using BV CCD images and echelle spectra of 52 supergiants. Isochrone fits to a BV color-magnitude diagram revealed that the primary cluster has an age of $\tau = 90 \pm 30$ Myr while the secondary member has $\tau = 6 \pm 5$ Myr. BV surface brightness profiles were constructed out to R $>$ 40 pc, and single-component King-Michie (KM) models were applied. The total cluster luminosity varied from L$_B$ = 2.60 - 2.65 $\times 10^6$ L$_B$\sol\ and L$_V$ = 1.25 - 1.35 $\times 10^6$ as the anisotropy radius varied from infinity to three times the scale radius with the isotropic models providing the best agreement with the data. Of the 52 stars with echelle spectra, a subset of 36 were used to study the cluster dynamics. The KM radial velocity distributions were fitted to these velocities yielding total cluster masses of 5.4 - 5.9 $\pm 2.4 \times 10^4$ M\sol\ corresponding to M/L$_B$ = 0.02 $\pm 0.01$ M\sol/L$_B$\sol\ or M/L$_V$ = 0.05 $\pm 0.02$ M\sol/L$_V$\sol. A rotational signal in the radial velocities has been detected at the 93\% confidence level implying a rotation axis at a position angle of 100\deg. A variety of rotating models were fit to the velocity data assuming cluster ellipticities of $\epsilon = 0.1 - 0.3$. These models provided slightly better agreement with the radial velocity data than the KM models and had masses that were systematically lower by a few percent. The preferred value for the slope of a power-law IMF is a relatively shallow, $x = 0.29 \pmm{+0.3}{-0.8}$ assuming the B-band M/L or $x = 0.71 \pmm{+0.2}{-0.4}$ for the V-band.",1675,1992,,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,33.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9210004v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9210004v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9210004v1,astro-ph/9210004v1
Evidence for a Very Broad Line Region in PG 1138+222,"Paolo Marziani, Jack W. Sulentic",2,"We present a high S/N spectrum for the quasar PG 1138+222. We detect a very broad HeII$\lambda$4686 emission line component with twice the FWHM of the conventional broad line region (BLR) as evidenced by the Balmer lines. The profile shape and centroid redshift also distinguish this HeII component from the BLR features. The large ratio of HeII\l 4686 to any analogous H$\beta$ emission component is an indicator that it arises in a very high density region ($n_e \simgt 10^{11}-10^{13}$ \cm3). This Helium component is probably emitted in a Very Broad Line Region (VBLR), where the radiation field is so strong that the Str\""omgren depth becomes similar to the geometrical thickness of the emitting clouds.

On the Origin of the Galactic Magnetic Field,Ethan T. Vishniac,1,"The galactic magnetic field is commonly supposed to be due to a dynamo acting on some large scale seed field. A major difficulty with this idea is that estimates of reasonable seed field strengths tend to be quite low, on the order of $\sim10^{-20}$ gauss. Here we examine the contribution due to the flux entrained in winds from protostars formed in the first dynamo e-folding time of a galaxy's existence. Using a minimal estimate of a protostellar magnetic field we find that if each protostar ejects a single current ring, sufficient to maintain flux freezing in the wind, than the large scale average dipole field from all such current rings will be at least 5 orders of magnitude larger than previous seed field estimates. Allowing for a reasonable amount of magnetic activity in protostars during an extended period of mass loss increases this to a dipole seed field of $\sim10^{-12}$ gauss. For the purposes of producing a seed field it is irrelevant whether or not this initial injection of flux takes place in a newly formed galactic disk, or in star forming proto-galactic clouds. The compression of this dipole field into a thin disk will lead to a large scale $B_r\sim 10^{-10.5}$ gauss. Initially, field strengths on smaller scales will be larger, but nowhere near current levels.",1294,1992,,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,33.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9210006v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9210006v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9210006v1,astro-ph/9210006v1

The evolution of the abundances of 15 elements or isotopes is followed with detailed stellar nucleosynthesis. Stellar lifetimes are taken into account and a new IMF has been adopted.

On the General Properties of Matter,Mario Everaldo de Souza,1,"By means of a general classification of the different kinds of matter of nature form a chain from the world of the subatomic particles to the large bodies of the universe, the galaxies. Then, it proposes a new baryonic force for the universe that is the fifth force which has been proposed in the literature. It explains the universal expansion itself and shows why the expansion must be slowing down at present. This force depends on the ratio of the number of neutrons to the number of protons. Its potential for the Universe is a well. At the bottom of the well the potential is of the form $kx^2$, where $x$ is the separation among the bodies under consideration. It is suggested that Nature has six fundamental forces which are unified in pairs and, therefore, reduced to three at $t=0$. The condition for having a closed universe is found. This new force, called superweak force in this paper, explains also the evolution of galaxies and shows how the arms of spiral galaxies(including barred spirals) are formed. The variation of the Hubble constant with time is shown. It is shown that quarks are formed of prequarks which may be the true elementary particles.

A rotating black hole in the Galactic Center,"Heino Falcke, Peter L. Biermann, Wolfgang J. Duschl, Peter G.

We therefore calculate the appearance of a standard accretion disk around a Kerr hole in Sgr A* following from general relativity and a few fundamental assumptions. Effective temperature and luminosity of the disk spectra do not depend on the unknown viscosity mechanism but instead are quite sensitive to variations of intrinsic parameters: the mass, the accretion rate, the angular momentum of the accreting hole and the inclination angle. A radiation field of L~7 10^4 - 7 10^5 L_sun and T_eff ~ 2-4 10^4 K can be ascribed to a rapidly rotating Kerr~hole (a>0.9) accreting 10^-8.5 - 10^-7 M_sun/yr at a black~hole mass of M=2 10^6 M_sunseen almost edge on.

Gravity's rainbow,"George F. Smoot, Paul J. Steinhardt",2,"Could COBE DMR be detecting the imprint from a spectrum of gravitational waves generated during inflation? The conventional inflationary prediction had been that the cosmic microwave anisotropy is dominated by energy density fluctuations generated during inflation and that the gravitational waves contribute negligibly. In this paper, we report on recent work (in collaboration with R. Davis, H. Hodges, and M. Turner) that has shown that the conventional wisdom may be wrong; specifically, gravitational waves may dominate the anisotropy in inflationary models where the spectrum of perturbations deviates significantly from scale invariance (e.g., extended and power-law inflation models and extreme versions of chaotic inflation). If gravitational waves do dominate at the large-angular scales measured by COBE DMR, the expectation and interpretation of anisotropies on small-angular scales is profoundly altered.

We show that the Balmer line fluxes and profile shapes undergo remarkable changes. The ratio of intensities between the broad and narrow components of Hbeta increased monotonically from 15 in 1985 to 40 in 1991. The peak of the broad components of Hbeta and Halpha were known to be strongly displaced to the red. We have discovered a correlation between the amplitude of the broad peak displacement and the luminosity of Hbeta, in the sense that the displacement is larger when the line luminosity is higher. We suggest that the observations are not compatible with either a binary Broad Line Region model or one involving ballistic acceleration of the line emitting gas. Radiative acceleration of a system of outflowing clouds readily explains the correlation between line shift and luminosity as well as the peculiar line profiles. Furthermore, it seems that most or all of the Balmer emission originates from the inward face of the clouds.

The Evolution of the Globular Cluster System in a Triaxial Galaxy: Can a Galactic Nucleus Form by Globular Cluster Capture?,R.

In this paper I examine the possibility that some of galactic nuclei have been formed by frictionally decayied globular clusters moving in a triaxial potential. The initial rapid growth of the nucleus, due mainly to massive clusters on box orbits falling in a short time scale into the galactic centre, is found to be later slowed by tidal disruption induced by the nucleus itself on less massive clusters in the way described by Ostriker, Binney & Saha.   The efficiency of dynamical friction is such to carry to the centre of the galaxy enough globular cluster mass available to form a compact nucleus, but the actual modes of its collisionless formation remains to be investigated.   The mass of the resulting nucleus is determined by the mutual feedback of the two mentioned processes, together with the knowlegde of the initial spatial, velocity and mass distributions of the globular cluster family.

Cosmic Rays I.: The cosmic ray spectrum between 10 TeV and 3 EeV,Peter L. Biermann,1,"I develop a theory to account for the cosmic ray spectrum.

I use the basic concept, that the energetic Cosmic Ray particles are accelerated in a Supernova shock that travels down a stellar wind. Discussion gives a knee energy expression, which leads to a suggestion on the physical origin of the mechanical energy of Supernova explosions, the gravitational potential energy mediated by the angular momentum and the magnetic field. The spectrum below the knee is $E^{-8/3}$. At the knee the particles segregate with particle energy according to their charge. The spectrum beyond the knee is very close to $E^{-3}$.

The line brightness temperature is > 160 K in the di- rection of theta 1C, more than twice the dust temperature, and still exceeds 35 K more than a parsec east of theta 1C. The lines are narrow, with a max- imum velocity width of 7 km s^-1 near theta 1C and decreasing to 1.5-3 km s^-1 at the map boundaries.

To the east of theta 1C the CO(7-6) lines split into two velo- city components (also seen in 13CO(2-1) emission) which persist over several arcminutes. Since only one of these components can be on the surface, the other must arise from a dense, UV-illuminated clump or filament within the molecular cloud. Comparison of the quiescent CO(7-6) emission to CO(7-6) ob- served in a cross-map of the energetic Orion KL outflow shows that the lumino- sity of shock-excited CO(7-6) emission in Orion is only a few percent of the luminosity of the widespread quiescent CO(7-6) emission.",1522,1993,Astrophys.J. 410 (1993) 179-187,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9301009v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9301009v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9301009v1,astro-ph/9301009v1
"Extragalactic ultra high energy cosmic rays, I. Contribution from hot spots in FR-II galaxies","Joerg P. Rachen, Peter L. Biermann",2,"We consider the hot spots in FR-II galaxies as sites of first order Fermi acceleration of protons to the highest energies observed in cosmic rays. We estimate the attainable maximum energy in the hot spot region allowed by the canonical physical conditions, which are found from radio-to-optical observations (Meisenheimer et al. 1989, A&A). We calculate observable the proton flux and spectrum from this sources, using all knowledge about source distibution (Peacock 1985, MNRAS) and particle transport in the microwave background (Berezinsky and Grigor'eva 1988, A&A).

Minimal Microwave Anisotropy from Perturbations Induced at Late Times,"Andrew H. Jaffe, Albert Stebbins, Joshua A. Frieman",3,"Aside from primordial gravitational instability of the cosmological fluid, various mechanisms have been proposed to generate large-scale structure at relatively late times, including, e.g., ``late-time'' cosmological phase transitions. In these scenarios, it is envisioned that the universe is nearly homogeneous at the time of last scattering and that perturbations grow rapidly sometime after the primordial plasma recombines. On this basis, it was suggested that large inhomogeneities could be generated while leaving relatively little imprint on the cosmic microwave background (MBR) anisotropy. In this paper, we calculate the minimal anisotropies possible in any ``late-time'' scenario for structure formation, given the level of inhomogeneity observed at present. Since the growth of the inhomogeneity involves time-varying gravitational fields, these scenarios inevitably generate significant MBR anisotropy via the Sachs-Wolfe effect. Moreover, we show that the large-angle MBR anisotropy produced by the rapid post-recombination growth of inhomogeneity is generally greater than that produced by the same inhomogeneity grown via gravitational instability. In ``realistic'' scenarios one can decrease the anisotropy compared to models with primordial adiabatic fluctuations, but only on very small angular scales. The value of any particular measure of the anisotropy can be made small in late-time models, but only by making the time-dependence of the gravitational field sufficiently ``pathological''.",1512,1993,Astrophys.J. 420 (1994) 9-25,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9301011v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9301011v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9301011v1,astro-ph/9301011v1

Angular Momentum Loss in Low Mass Accretion Disks,"ET Vishniac, PH Diamond",2,"We review mechanisms for the transport of angular momentum in accretion disks that are low mass, in the sense that the gravitational forces produced by the material in these disks has a negligible effect on disk dynamics. There is no established consensus on how this transport takes place. We note that for phenomenological reasons the traditional $\alpha$ model is probably not a good description of real disks. We discuss models in which angular momentum transport is driven by shocks, and by magnetic field instabilities. The latter is more promising, but requires a dynamo. We note that the direction of angular momentum transport due to convection in a conducting disk is not known as competing mechanisms are at work. We briefly discuss a number of possible dynamo mechanisms, and their problems. We then give a detailed exposition of the internal wave driven dynamo model, in which internal waves excited at large radii drive an $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo.",960,1993,,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9302001v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9302001v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9302001v1,astro-ph/9302001v1
Background Radiation,"G. De Zotti, A. Franceschini, L. Toffolatti, P. Mazzei, L. Danese",5,"We present a short overview on the extragalactic background radiation from radio to X-rays, with an eye to the relation to galaxy formation and emphasizing on astrophysical backgrounds (as opposed to cosmological). As the radio background, the wealth of data on source counts make possible reliable estimations of the contribution from extragalactic sources. At 178 MHz we obtain an antenna temperature of about 22 K, with the 60% of the flux contributed by radiogalaxies and quasars and the remaining part from sub-mJy radio sources. At high frequencies the compact sources, generally QSOs, dominate. An intense far-IR/sub-mm background is predicted if a large fraction of the hard X-ray Background (XRB) comes from starburst galaxies but this might face problems with the upper limits on the far-IR isotropic flux. To clarify the problem spectral measurements should be complemented with the analysis of small scale anisotropies. The flattening of the QSO counts at B=19.5 suggests that their contribution to the optical/near-IR background is small in comparison to that of galaxies. As for the XRB, a consisting picture obtains considering two AGN populations: a ""soft X-ray spectrum"" population and a ""hard X-ray spectrum"" one, mainly contributing to the soft and to the hard XRB respectively. A third population of extremely absorbed or of reflection dominated AGN could either be the dominant contributor of the XRB above 3 keV.",1434,1993,,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9302004v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9302004v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9302004v1,astro-ph/9302004v1

Since the contribution of FR-II hot spots is expected to be dominated by protons, we can also compare it to the recent experimental results for the proton component of cosmic rays between 0.1 and 1 EeV from both the Fly's Eye and the Akeno airshower detector (Gaisser et al. 1993, Phys Rev D in press, and Stanev et al. 1992, A&A submitted). The result is striking: Our prediction for energies below 1 EeV fits very well to the data for the proton component, while explaining the total flux at highest energies as well.

Biasing and Hierarchical Statistics in Large-scale Structure,"J. N. Fry, Enrique Gaztanaga",2,"In the current paradigm there is a non-trivial bias expected in the process of galaxy formation. Thus, the observed statistical properties of the galaxy distribution do not necessarily extend to the underlying matter distribution. Gravitational evolution of initially Gaussian seed fluctuations predicts that the connected moments of the matter fluctuations exhibit a hierarchical structure, at least in the limit of small dispersion. This same hierarchical structure has been found in the galaxy distribution, but it is not clear to what extent it reflects properties of the matter distribution or properties of a galaxy formation bias. In this paper we consider the consequences of an arbitrary, effectively local biasing transformation of a hierarchical underlying matter distribution. We show that a general form of such a transformation preserves the hierarchical properties and the shape of the dispersion in the limit of small fluctuations, i.e. on large scales, although the values of the",996,1993,Astrophys.J. 413 (1993) 447-452,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9302009v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9302009v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9302009v2,astro-ph/9302009v2

We come to a similar conclusion about CDM models with positively skewed initial fluctuation distributions.

The tight upper limits set by ROSAT deep survey data on the ACF at arcmin scales imply strong constraints on clustering properties of X-ray sources at cosmological distances and on their contribution to the soft XRB. If quasars have a clustering radius r_0=12-20 Mpc (H_0=50), and their two point correlation function, is constant in comoving coordinates as indicated by optical data, they cannot make up more 40-50% of the soft XRB (the maximum contribution may reach 80% in the case of stable clustering, epsilon=0). Active Star-forming (ASF) galaxies clustered like normal galaxies, with r_0=10-12 Mpc can yield up to 20% or up to 40% of the soft XRB for epsilon=-1.2 or epsilon=0, respectively. The ACF on degree scales essentially reflects the clustering properties of local sources and is proportional to their volume emissivity. The upper limits on scales of a few degrees imply that hard X-ray selected AGNs have r_0<25 Mpc if epsilon=0 or r_0<20 Mpc if epsilon=-1.2. No significant constraints are set on clustering of ASF galaxies, due to their low local volume emissivity.

We show that the method proposed by Coles \& Frenk (1991), which uses the skewness of galaxy counts to test the hypothesis of Gaussian primordial density fluctuations, is a potentially powerful probe of initial conditions. As expected, the mass distribution in models with initially non--Gaussian fluctuations shows systematic departures from the Gaussian behaviour on intermediate to large scales. We investigate the effect of peculiar velocity distortions and normalisation upon the relationship between skewness and variance. These effects are generally small for the models we consider.

The magnitude of two biases, the overexposure of the central part of galaxies and the inclination of the spiral parent galaxies, have been estimated. We show that due to overexposure a increasing fraction of SNe is lost in galaxies of increasing distances. Also, a reduced number of SNe is discovered in inclined galaxies ($i>30\degr$): SNII and Ib are more affected than Ia, as well as SNe in Sbc-Sd galaxies with respect to other spirals. We strengthen previous findings that the SN rates is proportional to the galaxy blue luminosity for all SN and Hubble types. Other sources of errors, besides those due to the statistics of the events, have been investigated. In particular those related to the adopted SN parameters (Cappellaro et al.

Cosmic Rays IV. The spectrum and chemical composition above $10^4$ GeV,"T. Stanev, P. L. Biermann, T. K.

Using existing data on the chemical composition of cosmic rays near TeV energies as a constraint, we adjust the parameters of the model to fit the shower size data from the Akeno experiment; this is necessary since the derivation of an all particle spectrum involves an assumption about the chemical composition of the cosmic rays and so we have to fit the shower size data first and then derive the all particle spectrum. We present a successful fit to the shower size data which allows us to draw three main conclusions: a) For most of the energy range above $10^5$ GeV the wind explosions can account for both chemical composition and spectrum including the knee feature, b) the highest particle energies required from the stellar wind explosions imply a magnetic field in the preexisting stellar wind of at least $3$ Gauss at a fiducial distance of $10^{14}$ cm, c) the chemical abundances above $10^5$ GeV are dominated by heavy nuclei such as Neon and higher.

If the R-band light is dominated by old stars in the underlying density wave, then the results suggest evidence for a Star Formation law which exhibits a threshold dependence on the strength of the density wave in the rings. Even if the R-band continuum in the ring is heavily contaminated with red light from the underlying young stars then a smaller, but still significant non-linear enhancement in the star formation rates (SFR) in one segment of the second ring is required to explain the results. In either case, strong trends in the SFR with azimuth around Ring~2 are in good agreement with off-center collisional ring galaxy models.",1191,1993,"Astrophys.J.414:154-164,1993",arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9303008v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9303008v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9303008v1,astro-ph/9303008v1

Perturbation Spectra from Intermediate Inflation,"John D Barrow, Andrew R Liddle",2,"We investigate models of `intermediate' inflation, where the scale factor $a(t)$ grows as $a(t) = \exp (A t^f)$, $0 < f < 1$, $A$ constant. These solutions arise as exact analytic solutions for a given class of potentials for the inflaton $\phi$. For a simpler class of potentials falling off as a power of $\phi$ they arise as slow-roll solutions, and in particular they include, for $f = 2/3$, the class of potentials which give the Harrison--Zel'dovich spectrum. The perturbation spectral index $n$ can be greater than unity on astrophysical scales. It is also possible to generate substantial gravitational waves while keeping the scalar spectrum close to scale-invariance; this latter possibility performs well when confronted with most observational data.",761,1993,"Phys.Rev.D47:5219-5223,1993",arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9303011v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9303011v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9303011v1,astro-ph/9303011v1
"Cosmic Rays, III. The CR spectrum between 1 GeV and 10^4 GeV and the radio emission from supernova remnants","Peter L. Biermann, Richard G. Strom",2,"We develop a theory to account for the cosmic ray spectrum between 1 GeV and 10^4 GeV following the earlier papers of this series. We use the basic concept that the cosmic ray particles are accelerated in a supernova shock that travels through the interstellar medium. Physically important ingredients besides the presence of a strong shock are diffusion, drifts, convection, adiabatic cooling, the injection history, and the topology of the magnetic field, here assumed for simplicity to be homogeneous in the interstellar medium. The result is a spectrum, which for strong shocks in a gas with adiabatic index 5/3 yields a spectrum of E^-2.42. Interstellar turbulence with a Kolmogorov spectrum then leads by leakage from the galactic disk to a spectrum which is E^-2.75, as observed. We argue that the ratio of cosmic ray electrons to protons is determined by the amount of expansion which takes place from the cessation of electron injection to the break-up of the shell by cooling instabilities. Since the highest particle energy reached derives from geometrical arguments, it depends on the charge of the nucleus and so higher Z elements are predicted to reach higher energies.",1183,1993,,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9303013v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9303013v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9303013v1,astro-ph/9303013v1
Determination of pseudo-Goldstone boson-photon coupling by the differential time delay of pulsar signals,"Subhendra Mohanty, S. N. Nayak",2,Pseudo-Goldstone bosons couple with photons through a P and T violating interaction of the form ${\cal {L_I}}=g_{a\gamma \gamma}~ a F\tilde F$. Strong magnetic fields in rotating compact stars induce a non-zero ${\vec E}\cdot{\vec B}$ outside the stellar surface which acts as a source for the pseudo-scalar field. Pulsar signals propagating through this pseudo-scalar `hair' suffer a differential time lag between the left and the right circularly polarised modes because of the P and T violating pseudoscalar boson-photon interaction. Determination of this time lag upto a microsecond accuracy can lead to a measurment of (or rule out) pseudo-Goldstone boson-photon coupling upto $g_{a \gamma \gamma}\leq 4.6 \times 10^{-9}~GeV^{-1}$.,736,1993,,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9303015v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9303015v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9303015v1,astro-ph/9303015v1

The mean ratio of \Lya\ to Lyman $\beta$ absorption in the clouds is $0.476\pm 0.054$. We also detect, and obtain ratios, for Lyman $\beta$, $\gamma$, and possibly $\epsilon$. We are also able to quantify the fluctuations of the absorption around its mean, and find that these are comparable to, or perhaps slightly larger than, that expected from an uncorrelated distribution of clouds.

We show how the exponential itself emerges in a natural way. An absolute normalization for the differential distribution of cloud numbers in $z$, $N$, and $b$ is obtained. By detailed analysis of absorption fluctuations along the line of sight we are able to put upper limits on the cloud-cloud correlation function $\xi$ on several megaparsec length scales. We show that observed $b$ values, if thermal, are incompatible, in several different ways, with the hypothesis of equilibrium heating and ionization by a background UV flux. Either a significant component of $b$ is due to bulk motion (which we argue against on several grounds), or else the clouds are out of equilibrium, and hotter than is implied by their ionization state, a situation which could be indicative of recent adiabatic collapse.",1187,1993,Astrophys.J. 418 (1993) 585,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9303017v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9303017v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9303017v1,astro-ph/9303017v1

Do Observations Exclude Gamma-ray Bursts Originating In the Oort Cloud Of Comets?,Eyal Maoz,1,"As long as there is no distance indicator to the sources of gamma-ray bursts all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list. We use the available data on the bursts' distribution of (the BATSE catalogue), and the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits by Marsden and Williams (1992) to investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations between the angular distributions of bursts and comets' aphelia, assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect, at least to some extent, true variations in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the V/V_{max} test to both distributions. We have performed a variety of statistical tests (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a $\chi^2$ test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for isolating the effect of possible observational biases. These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but the statistical significance is not sufficient for ruling out any connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\sim 800$ it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions. Currently, it is only the combination of these tests with the large disagreement found for the V/V_{max} parameter which makes the Oort cloud of comets unlikely to be related to gamma-ray bursts.",1570,1993,Astrophys.J. 414 (1993) 877,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304001v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9304001v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304001v1,astro-ph/9304001v1

We use power--law spectra $P(k) \propto k^n$ with indices $n=-3,~-2,~-1,~0,~1$. Due to the supposed absence of characteristic times or scales in our models, all quantities are expected to depend on a single scaling variable. For each model, the moments at all times can be expressed in terms of the variance $\overline \xi_2$, alone. We look for agreement with the hierarchical scaling ansatz, according to which $\overline \xi_q \propto \overline \xi_2^{~q-1}$. For $n\leq -2$ models we find strong deviations from the hierarchy, which are mostly due to the presence of boundary problems in the simulations. A small, residual signal of deviation from the hierarchical scaling is however also found in $n \geq -1$ models.

Multiwavelength Monitoring of the BL Lac Object PKS 2155-304 I. The IUE Campaign,C. M. Urry,1,"Daily monitoring of PKS 2155-304 with the IUE satellite throughout November 1991 has revealed dramatic, large-amplitude, rapid variations in the ultraviolet flux of this BL Lac object. Many smaller, rapid flares are superimposed on a general doubling of the intensity. During the five-day period when sampling was roughly continuous, the rapid flaring had an apparent quasi-periodic nature, with peaks repeating every ~0.7 days. The short- and long-wavelength ultraviolet light curves are well correlated with each other, and with the optical light curve deduced from the Fine Error Sensor (FES) on IUE. The formal lag is zero but the cross-correlation if asymmetric in the sense that the shorter wavelength emission leads the longer. The ultraviolet spectral shape varies a small but significant amount. The correlation between spectral shape and intensity is complicated; an increase in intensity is associated with spectral hardening, but lags behind the spectral change by ~1 day. The sign of the correlation is consistent with the nonthermal acceleration processes expected in relativistic plasmas, so that the present results are consistent with relativistic jet models, which can also account for quasi-periodic flaring. In contrast, currently proposed accretion disk models are stronly ruled out by the simultaneous optical and ultraviolet variability.",1360,1993,Astrophys.J. 411 (1993) 614-631,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304003v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9304003v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304003v2,astro-ph/9304003v2

Such observations allow measurements of the rotational velocity out to 1.8 a_e (effective radii) from the galaxy center, where the surface brightness is \mu_B ~ 24 mag arcsec**-2. The rotation curve quickly reaches an asymptotic value, v_f ~ 260 km/s, with only marginal indication of systematic decline within the range of our observations.

The main distorting agents in the mapping at shorter wavelengths are dust extinction and luminous young stars. From modeling the color changes across the main dust lanes in M51, we find that the K-band flux is attenuated by only $\ltorder 10\%$ even in the dust lanes. From monitoring the gravity-sensitive CO$(2.3\mu )$ index across the spiral arms we find that young, red supergiants do not distort significantly the K-band image except in one small patch. On this basis, {\it we conclude that K band images do trace the massive disk star population}.

The Neutrino Ball Model of a Quasar,"R. Manka, I. Bednarek, D. Karczewska",3,It is suggested that the nonorthodox model of a quasar as a neutrino ball described in terms of the standard model extended by adding right-handed neutrinos and the Majorana scalar field can be presented in order to explain a quasar as a body of weak interacting neutrinos. Neutrino interaction with the scalar Majorana field violates the lepton number and produces the mass splitting of the neutrino due to the sea-saw mechanism. In this model a quasar is an object which appears in the result of the first order cosmological phase transition. In this interpretation a quasar may be regarded as a ball filled with Dirac neutrinos and can be treated as a remnant of phase transition with unbroken global lepton symmetry.

Indications for Gamma-Ray Bursts Originating within an Extended Galactic Halo ?,Eyal Maoz,1,"If a substantial fraction of the observed gamma-ray bursts originates within an extended Galactic halo then their spatial distribution should deviate slightly from spherical symmetry in a very particular way which involves features both in the bursts' angular and radial distributions.   This conclusion is based on various reasons which are all related to the presence and motion of the satellite galaxies around the Galaxy, and is independent of the nature and origin of the sources.   We analyze the spatial distribution of the bursts, according to the BATSE catalog until March 1992, and argue that the expected signature of an extended Galactic halo model is indicated by the data. The distance to the faintest bursts in the halo is either $\sim130$ Kpc or $\sim270$ Kpc.   Although a signature of a nearby-extragalactic distance scale in the data is very suggestive, we argue that a comparison with specific models is necessary before regarding our findings as a conclusive evidence.

On the Bimodal Distribution of Gamma-Ray Bursts,"Shude Mao, Ramesh Narayan, Tsvi Piran",3,"Kouveliotou et al. (1993) recently confirmed that gamma-ray bursts are bimodal in duration. In this paper we compute the statistical properties of the short ($\le 2$~s) and long ($>2$~s) bursts using a method of analysis that makes no assumption regarding the location of the bursts, whether in the Galaxy or at a cosmological distance. We find the 64 ms channel on BATSE to be more sensitive to short bursts and the 1024 ms channel is more sensitive to long bursts. We show that all the currently available data are consistent with the simple hypothesis that both short and long bursts have the same spatial distribution and that within each population the sources are standard candles. The rate of short bursts is $\sim 0.4$ of the rate of long bursts. Although the durations of short and long gamma-ray bursts span several orders of magnitude and the total energy of a typical short burst is smaller than that of a typical long burst by a factor of $\sim 20$, surprisingly the peak luminosities of the two kinds of bursts are equal to within a factor of $\sim 2$.",1066,1993,,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304016v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9304016v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304016v1,astro-ph/9304016v1

Assuming that the square of meson fields develop nonzero expectation value, the thermodynamic potential for charge neutral interacting two and three flavour quark matter, in beta equilibrium, has been calculated up to second order in quark gluon interaction term in the Lagrangian. The equation of state has been found to be softer for higher quark masses and interaction strength. The quark stars properties are found to be dependent on EOS.

Quark Neutron Layer Stars,Philip A. Carinhas,1,"Typical nuclear equations of state and a quark bag model, surprisingly, allow compact stars with alternate layers of neutrons and quarks. One can determine on the basis of the Gibbs free energy which phase, nuclear or quark, is energetically favorable. Using the nuclear equation of state of Wiringa, and a quark equation of state given by Freedman and McLerran, the allowed quark parameter space for such layer stars is searched. This paper differs from past work in that configurations are found in which quark matter is located exterior and interior to shells of nuclear matter, i.e., dependent on quark parameters, a star may contain several alternating layers of quark and nuclear matter. Given the uncertainty in the quark parameter space, one can estimate the probability for finding pure neutron stars, pure quark stars (strange stars), stars with a quark core and a nucleon exterior, or layer stars. Several layer models are presented. The physical characteristics, stability, and results of a thorough search of the quark parameter space are presented.",1062,1993,Astrophys.J. 412 (1993) 213-221,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304021v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9304021v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304021v2,astro-ph/9304021v2

We apply the formalism to the updated 1-in-6 QDOT IRAS redshift survey, and compare our results to data from other probes: APM angular correlations; the CfA and the Berkeley 1.2Jy IRAS redshift surveys. Our results bear out and further quantify the impression from e.g.\ counts-in-cells analysis that there is extra power on large scales as compared to the standard CDM model with $\Omega h\simeq 0.5$. We apply likelihood analysis using the CDM spectrum with $\Omega h$ as a free parameter as a phenomenological family of models; we find the best fitting parameters in redshift space and transform the results to real space. Finally, we calculate the distribution of the estimated long wavelength power. This agrees remarkably well with the exponential distribution expected for Gaussian fluctuations, even out to powers of ten times the mean.

MACHOs in a Flattened Halo,"Penny D. Sackett, Andrew Gould",2,"If massive compact halo objects (\ms) are detected in ongoing searches, then \tsmctlmc, the ratio of the optical depth toward the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, will be a robust indicator of the flattening of the Galactic dark matter halo. For a spherical halo, \tsmctlmc\ is about 1.45, independent of details of the shape of the Galactic rotation curve, the assumed mass of the Galactic disk and spheroid, and the truncation distance (if any) of the dark halo. For an E6 halo (axis ratio $c/a = 0.4$), the ratio of optical depths is \tsmctlmc\ $\sim 0.95$, again independent of assumptions about Galactic parameters. This ratio can be measured with a precision as good as $\sim 10\%$ depending on the typical mass of the MACHOs. If the halo is highly flattened (\eg E6) and closely truncated (\eg at twice the solar galactocentric radius), then the optical depth toward the LMC can be reduced by a factor of about two. For these extreme parameters, and the assumption of a heavy Galactic disk and spheroid, the upper limit of the \m\ mass range to which ongoing experiments are sensitive is reduced from ${\cal O}(10^6)\,M_\odot$ to ${\cal O}(10)\,M_\odot$.",1163,1993,,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304023v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9304023v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304023v1,astro-ph/9304023v1

Kinematic Signature of a Rotating Bar Near a Resonance,Martin D. Weinberg,1,"There have been several recent suggestions that the Milky Way has rotating bar-like features based on HI and star count data. In this paper, I show that such features cause distinctive stellar kinematic signatures near OLR and ILR. The effects of these resonances may be observable far from the peak density of the pattern and relatively nearby the solar position. The details of the kinematic signatures depend on the evolutionary history of the `bar' and therefore velocity data, both systemic and velocity dispersion, may be used to probe the evolutionary history as well as the present state of the Galaxy. Kinematic models for a variety of simple scenarios are presented. Models with evolving pattern speeds show significantly stronger dispersion signatures than those with static pattern speeds, suggesting that useful observational constraints are possible. The models are applied to the proposed rotating spheroid and bar models; we find: 1) none of these models chosen to represent the proposed large-scale rotating spheroid are consistent with the stellar kinematics; and 2) a Galactic bar with semimajor axis of $3\kpc$ will cause a large increase in velocity dispersion in the vicinity of OLR ($\sim5\kpc$) with little change in the net radial motion and such a signature is suggested by K-giant velocity data.

Hydrodynamic Instability and Coalescence of Binary Neutron Stars,"D. Lai, F. A. Rasio, S. L. Shapiro",3,"We study the importance of hydrodynamic effects on the evolution of coalescing binary neutron stars. Using an approximate energy functional constructed from equilibrium solutions for polytropic binary configurations, we incorporate hydrodynamic effects into the calculation of the orbital decay driven by gravitational wave emission. In particular, we follow the transition between the quasi-static, secular decay of the orbit at large separation and the rapid dynamical evolution of configurations approaching contact. We show that a purely Newtonian hydrodynamic instability can significantly accelerate the coalescence at small separation. Such an instability occurs in all close binary configurations containing sufficiently incompressible stars. Calculations are performed for various neutron star masses, radii, spins, and effective polytropic indices. Typically, we find that the radial infall velocity just prior to contact is about 10\% of the tangential orbital velocity. Post-Newtonian effects can move the stability limit to a larger binary separation, and may induce an even larger radial velocity. We also consider the possibility of mass transfer from one neutron star to the other. We show that stable mass transfer is impossible except when the mass of one of the components is very small (less than about 0.4 solar mass) and the viscosity is high enough to maintain corotation.",1395,1993,Astrophys.J. 420 (1994) 811-829,arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304027v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9304027v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304027v1,astro-ph/9304027v1

Tidally Induced Elongation and Alignments of Galaxy Clusters,"Eduard Salvador-Sole, Jose M. Solanes",2,"We show that tidal interaction among galaxy clusters can account for their observed alignments and very marked elongation and, consequently, that these characteristics of clusters are actually consistent with them being formed in hierarchical clustering. The well-established distribution of projected axial ratios of clusters with richness class $R\ge 0$ is recovered very satisfactorily by means of a simple model with no free parameters. The main perturbers are relatively rich ($R\ge 1$) single clusters and/or groups of clusters (superclusters) of a wider richness class ($R\ge 0$) located within a distance of about 65 $h^{-1}$ Mpc from the perturbed cluster. This makes the proposed scheme be also consistent with all reported alignment effects involving clusters. We find that this tidal interaction is typically in the saturate regime (\ie the maximum elongation allowed for systems in equilibrium is reached), which explains the very similar intrinsic axial ratio shown by all clusters. Tides would therefore play an important role in the dynamics of large scale structures, in particular, they should be taken into account when estimating the virial mass of clusters.",1178,1993,"Astrophys.J.417:427,1993",arXiv Astrophysics,0,0,0,0,32.5,Astrophysics,astro-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304029v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9304029v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304029v1,astro-ph/9304029v1

"Cosmic Rays, II. Evidence for a magnetic rotator Wolf Rayet star origin","Peter L. Biermann, Joseph P.

As a test we first demonstrate that the magnetic fields implied by this argument are compatible with the dynamo limit applied to the convective interior of the main sequence stars which are predecessors of Wolf Rayet stars; second we show that this implies the same strength of the magnetic fields as is suggested by the magnetically driven wind theory. Third, we use data from radio supernovae to check the spectrum, luminosity and time dependence which suggest that the magnetic fields again have to be as high as suggested by the magnetically driven wind theory. This constitutes evidence for the magnetic field strengths required to accelerate particles to 3 10^9 GeV. Fourth, we demonstrate that within our picture the nonthermal radio emission from OB and Wolf Rayet stars can reproduce the proper radio spectra, time variability and radio luminosities.

Logarithmically slow domain growth in nonrandomly frustrated systems: Ising models with competing interactions,"Joel D. Shore, Mark Holzer, James P. Sethna",3,"It is known that in systems which contain randomness explicitly in their Hamiltonians (e.g., due to impurities), the characteristic size L of the ordered domains can grow only logarithmically with time t following a quench below the transition temperature. However, in systems without such imposed randomness, much faster power law growth has generally been predicted. Motivated by the slow dynamics present in glasses, we have been looking for counterexamples, i.e., for models without randomness which nonetheless order logarithmically slowly. Here, we discuss two closely related models for which we have simple physical arguments that such slow growth occurs. The basis of these arguments is the claim that the free energy barriers to domain growth in these models are proportional to L. Thus, the barriers grow as the domains coarsen. We present the results of Monte Carlo simulations, which lend strong support to our claims of growing barriers and logarithmically slow dynamics. Finally, we discuss how quickly the system orders when it is cooled continuously through the transition (rather than quenched).",1113,1992,"Phys. Rev.

Absence of Dipole Transitions in Vortices of Type II Superconductors,Theodore C.

Of interest are frequencies near $\Delta^{2}/E_{F}$, where $\Delta$ is the bulk energy gap and $E_{F}$ is the fermi energy. The low temperature, clean, extreme type II limit and maintaining of equilibrium with the lattice are assumed. A simplification occurs for large planar mass anisotropy. Thus the results may be pertinent to materials such as $NbSe_2$ and high temperature superconductors. The expected dipole transition between core states is hidden because of the self consistent nature of the vortex potential.

Coulomb drag between two-dimensional electron systems,"Antti-Pekka Jauho, Henrik Smith",2,"The Coulomb contribution to the temperature-dependent rate of momentum transfer, $1/\tau_D$, between two electron systems in parallel layers is determined by setting up two coupled Boltzmann equations, with the boundary condition that no current flows in the layer where an induced voltage is measured. The effective Coulomb interaction between the layers is determined selfconsistently, allowing for the finite thickness of the layers. As $T\rightarrow 0$, we find that $1/\tau_DT^2$ approaches a constant value. At higher temperatures $1/\tau_DT^2$ exhibits a maximum at $T=T_{\rm max}$ and then decreases as $1/T$ with increasing temperature. The value of $T_{\rm max}$ depends on the layer separation $d$ according to $T_{\rm max}\propto d^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha\simeq 0.8$. The overall magnitude of the calculated $1/\tau_D$ is approximately one half of the results of a recent experiment, suggesting that other mechanisms of momentum transfer may be important.",969,1992,,arXiv Condensed Matter Physics,0,0,0,0,33.5,Condensed Matter Physics,cond-mat,https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9205001v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9205001v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9205001v1,cond-mat/9205001v1
Roughening of Reconstructed Crystal Surfaces and the Hubbard Model,"Leon Balents, Mehran Kardar",2,"We consider a model of a reconstructed crystal surface, first considered by Villain and Vilfan (Europhys.

The model is studied by a mapping to a spin--1/2 Fermion system in 1+1 dimensions, which, in the absence of islands, is precisely the Hubbard model. We consider a general $\pbyo$ reconstruction, in the presence of inter--step interactions and closed islands. Our analysis predicts the existence of a new type of rough phase, with incommensurate correlations in the reconstruction order parameter and unusual momentum space singularities at a characteristic ``Fermi momentum'' and its harmonics, analagous to the Luttinger liquid of one--dimensional Fermions. The general phase structure for $p>1$ is as follows: for $p>2$, there is a flat ordered (FO), a rough incommensurate (RI), and a flat incommensurate phase (FI). The FO--RI and FO--FI transitions are of the commensurate to incommensurate type, and the FI--RI transition is in the Kosterlitz--Thouless (KT) universality class. For $p=2$, the FI phase is replaced by a flat disordered phase (FD), and there may be a new rough disordered phase (RD).

For the case of a short range interaction, $V(z)$, between the particle and the surface atom supporting a bound state, an explicit non-perturbative solution of the collision problem is presented. For finite and large $N$, there is no true sticking but only so-called Feshbach resonances. A finite sticking coefficient ${\sl s}(E)$ is obtained by introducing a small phonon decay rate $\eta$ and letting $N\to\infty$. Our main interest is in the behavior of ${\sl s}(E)$ as $E\to 0$. For a short range $V(z)$, we find ${\sl s}(E)\sim E^{1/2}$, regardless of the strength of the particle-phonon coupling. However, if $V(z)$ has a Coulomb $z^{-1}$ tail, we find ${\sl s}(E)\to\alpha$, where $0 < \alpha < 1$.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Compressible Fluid Flow in Two-Dimensional Channels,"M. Sun, C.

In the simulation area, an upstream source is maintained at constant density and temperature while a downstream reservoir is kept at vacuum. The channel is sufficiently long in the direction of the flow that the finite length has little effect on the properties of the fluid in the central region. The simulated system is represented by an efficient data structure, whose internal elements are created and manipulated dynamically in a layered fashion. Consequently the code is highly efficient and manifests completely linear performance in simulations of large systems. We obtain the steady-state velocity, temperature, and density distributions in the system. The velocity distribution across the channel is very nearly a quadratic function of the distance from the center of the channel and reveals velocity slip at the boundaries; the temperature distribution is only approximately a quartic function of this distance from the center to the channel. The density distribution across the channel is non-uniform. We attribute this non-uniformity to the relatively high Mach number, approximately 0.5, in the fluid flow. An equation for the density distribution based on simple compressibility arguments is proposed; its predictions agree well with the simulation results.

Allen",4,"A class of singlet superconductors with a gap function $\Delta({\bf k}, \omega_n)$ which is {\it odd} in both momentum and Matsubara frequency was proposed recently \cite{ba}. To show an instability in the {\it odd} gap channel, a model phonon propagator was used with the $p$-wave interaction strength larger than the $s$-wave. We argue that the positive scattering matrix element entering the Eliashberg equations leads to a constraint on the relative strength of $p$- and $s$-wave interactions which inhibits odd pairing. However, a general spin dependent electron-electron interaction can satisfy all constraints and produce the odd singlet gap. A possibility which may lead to an odd gap is a strongly antiferromagnetically correlated system, such as a high-$T_c$ material.",778,1992,,arXiv Condensed Matter Physics,0,0,0,0,33.5,Condensed Matter Physics,cond-mat,https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9206003v3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9206003v3.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9206003v3,cond-mat/9206003v3

The method is applied to a general renormalisable scalar field theory in four dimensions using dimensional regularisation to two loops and expanding about arbitrary background fields. Detailed results are also specialised to an $O(n)$ symmetric model with a single coupling constant. Extra boundary terms are introduced into the action which give rise to either Dirichlet or generalised Neumann boundary conditions for the quantum fields. For plane boundaries the resulting renormalisation group functions are in accord with earlier results but here the additional terms depending on the extrinsic curvature of the boundary are found. Various consistency relations are also checked and the implications of conformal invariance at the critical point where the $\beta$ function vanishes are also derived. The local Scr\""odinger equation for the wave functional defined by the functional integral under deformations of the boundary is also verified to two loops.

Magnetic and Dynamic Properties of the Hubbard Model in Infinite Dimensions,"M.

Solving the latter with quantum Monte Carlo procedures enables us to obtain exact results for the one and two-particle properties of the infinite dimensional Hubbard model. In particular we find antiferromagnetism and a pseudogap in the single-particle density of states for sufficiently large values of the intrasite Coulomb interaction at half filling. Both the antiferromagnetic phase and the insulating phase above the N\'eel temperature are found to be quickly suppressed on doping. The latter is replaced by a heavy electron metal with a quasiparticle mass strongly dependent on doping as soon as $n<1$.

Away from the surface we found evidence of a monotonic, power-law approach to the bulk density. Both density and contact-statistics results suggest that the deposit formed is sparse: the space-filling fraction is about 15%, and the average number of contacts is 2.

Vortex motion and the Hall effect in type II superconductors: a time dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory approach,Alan T. Dorsey,1,"Vortex motion in type II superconductors is studied starting from a variant of the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, in which the order parameter relaxation time is taken to be complex. Using a method due to Gor'kov and Kopnin, we derive an equation of motion for a single vortex ($B\ll H_{c2}$) in the presence of an applied transport current. The imaginary part of the relaxation time and the normal state Hall effect both break ``particle-hole symmetry,'' and produce a component of the vortex velocity parallel to the transport current, and consequently a Hall field due to the vortex motion. Various models for the relaxation time are considered, allowing for a comparison to some phenomenological models of vortex motion in superconductors, such as the Bardeen-Stephen and Nozi\`eres-Vinen models, as well as to models of vortex motion in neutral superfluids. In addition, the transport energy, Nernst effect, and thermopower are calculated for a single vortex. Vortex bending and fluctuations can also be included within this description, resulting in a Langevin equation description of the vortex motion. The Langevin equation is used to discuss the propagation of helicon waves and the diffusional motion of a vortex line.

Critical exponents of the degenerate Hubbard model,"Holger Frahm, Andreas Schadschneider",2,We study the critical behaviour of the \SUN{} generalization of the one-dimensional Hubbard model with arbitrary degeneracy $N$. Using the integrability of this model by Bethe Ansatz we are able to compute the spectrum of the low-lying excitations in a large but finite box for arbitrary values of the electron density and of the Coulomb interaction. This information is used to determine the asymptotic behaviour of correlation functions at zero temperature in the presence of external fields lifting the degeneracy. The critical exponents depend on the system parameters through a $N\times N$ dressed charge matrix implying the relevance of the interaction of charge- and spin-density waves.,693,1992,J.Phys.

Critical Behavior of Charge Density Waves Below Threshold: Numerical and Scaling Analysis,"Daniel S. Fisher, A.

Using the Fukuyama-Lee-Rice Hamiltonian with relaxational dynamics, the polarization and linear response are calculated numerically. ... On the irreversible approach to threshold, the response due to avalanches triggered by local instabilities dominates the polarizability, which diverges in one and two dimensions. Characteristic diverging length scales are studied using finite-size scaling of the sample-to-sample variations of the threshold field in finite systems and finite-size effects in the linear polarizability and the irreversible polarization. A dominant diverging correlation length is found which controls the threshold field distribution, finite-size effects in the irreversible polarization, and a cutoff size for the avalanche size distribution.

Any topological soliton $\alpha \in \pi_d(M)$ determines a quotient $\Stat_n(X,\alpha)$ of the group of framed braids on $X$, such that choices of allowed statistics for solitons of type $\alpha$ are given by unitary representations of $\Stat_n(X,\alpha)$ when $n$ solitons are present. In particular, when $M = S^2$, as in the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with Hopf term, and $\alpha \in \pi_2(S^2)$ is a generator, we compute that $\Stat_n(\R^2,\alpha) = \Z$, while $\Stat_n(S^2,\alpha) = \Z_{2n}$.

It is found that due to the energy resonance of the Ga 3$d$ states with nitrogen 2$s$ states, the cation $d$ bands are not inert, and features unusual for a III-V compound are found in the lower part of the valence band and in the valence charge density and density of states. To clarify the influence of the Ga $d$ states on the cohesive properties, additional full and frozen--overlapped-core calculations were performed for GaN, cubic ZnS, GaAs, and Si.

New Exactly Solvable Model of Strongly Correlated Electrons Motivated by High T_c Superconductivity,"Fabian H. L. Essler, Vladimir E. Korepin, Kareljan Schoutens",3,"We present a new model describing strongly correlated electrons on a general $d$-dimensional lattice. It differs from the Hubbard model by interactions of nearest neighbours, and it contains the $t$-$J$ model as a special case.

By using an $\eta$-pairing mechanism we can construct eigenstates of the hamiltonian with off-diagonal-long-range-order (ODLRO). These might help to relate the model to high-$T_c$ superconductivity.

In the vicinity of a point of charge conjugation symmetry the holon contribution to the observed Hall coefficient is small: the Hall coefficient follows the temperature dependence of the diamagnetic susceptibility with a sign determined by the Fermi surface shape.

Aspects of Spin Dynamics in the Cuprate Superconductors,H. Monien,1,One of the interesting aspects of the CuO superconductors is that superconductivity is happening so close to the antiferromagnetic state. The nuclear magnetic resonance and the recent neutron scattering experiments clearly indicate that magnetic correlations persist in to the heavily doped regime. In this paper we will discuss some of the details of the coupling of the nuclear magnetic spin to the conduction electron spins. Furthermore we will show that a simple band structure can explain the recent neutron scattering data in the \LaSrCuO material for the optimal concentration of $x\approx 0.15$ if the lifetime effects are included.,640,1992,,arXiv Condensed Matter Physics,0,0,0,0,33.5,Condensed Matter Physics,cond-mat,https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9209005v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9209005v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9209005v1,cond-mat/9209005v1

We propose that in $La_{2-x} Sr_x CuO_4$ this is due to antiferromagnetic ordering which is prevented by the low spatial dimensionality while in $YBa_2 Cu_3 O_{6.6}$ it is due to the interplay between antiferromagnetic fluctuations within a plane and singlet pairing of electrons between nearest neighbor planes.,462,1992,"Phys.Rev.Lett.70:2810-2814,1993; ERRATUM-ibid.71:210,1993",arXiv Condensed Matter Physics,0,0,0,0,33.5,Condensed Matter Physics,cond-mat,https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9209006v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9209006v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9209006v1,cond-mat/9209006v1

Spin liquid phase for the frustrated Quantum Heisenberg Antiferromagnet on a square lattice,Jaime Ferrer,1,"The existance of a spin disordered ground state for the frustrated Quantum Heisenberg Antiferromagnet on a square lattice is reconsidered. It is argued that there is a unique action which is continuous through the whole phase diagram, except at the Lifshitz point, so that the Neel and helicoidal states can not coexist and there has to be an intermediate spin liquid state. To show it, a detailed study combining Spin-Wave theory, Schwinger Bosons Mean Field Theory and a scaling analysis of the appropriate hydrodynamic action is performed.

Compared to existing reviews on long panels (Arellano and Hahn 2007; a section in Arellano and Bonhomme 2011) we discuss models with both individual and time effects, split-panel Jackknife bias corrections, unbalanced panels, distribution and quantile effects, and other extensions.

Instead we derive informative bounds on these average treatment effects. Our bounds do not impose (semi)parametric restrictions, for example, proportional hazards.

In these settings, the coefficients in both the objective function and the constraints of the mathematical programming problem may be estimated from data and hence involve sampling error. Our inference approach exploits the characterization of the solutions to these programming problems by complementarity conditions; by doing so, we can transform the problem of doing inference on the solution of a constrained optimization problem (a non-standard inference problem) into one involving inference based on a set of inequalities with pre-estimated coefficients, which is much better understood.

We characterize sharp bounds on the joint distribution of potential outcomes and testable implications of the Roy self-selection model under an instrumental constraint on the joint distribution of potential outcomes we call stochastically monotone instrumental variable (SMIV). We show that testing the Roy model selection is equivalent to testing stochastic monotonicity of observed outcomes relative to the instrument. We apply our sharp bounds to the derivation of a measure of departure from Roy self-selection to identify values of observable characteristics that induce the most costly misallocation of talent and sector and are therefore prime targets for intervention. Special emphasis is put on the case of binary outcomes, which has received little attention in the literature to date. For richer sets of outcomes, we emphasize the distinction between pointwise sharp bounds and functional sharp bounds, and its importance, when constructing sharp bounds on functional features, such as inequality measures.

Zero-rating of Content and its Effect on the Quality of Service in the Internet,"Manjesh K. Hanawal, Fehmina Malik, Yezekael Hayel",3,"The ongoing net neutrality debate has generated a lot of heated discussions on whether or not monetary interactions should be regulated between content and access providers. Among the several topics discussed, `differential pricing' has recently received attention due to `zero-rating' platforms proposed by some service providers. In the differential pricing scheme, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can exempt data access charges for on content from certain CPs (zero-rated) while no exemption is on content from other CPs. This allows the possibility for Content Providers (CPs) to make `sponsorship' agreements to zero-rate their content and attract more user traffic. In this paper, we study the effect of differential pricing on various players in the Internet. We first consider a model with a monopolistic ISP and multiple CPs where users select CPs based on the quality of service (QoS) and data access charges. We show that in a differential pricing regime 1) a CP offering low QoS can make have higher surplus than a CP offering better QoS through sponsorships. 2) Overall QoS (mean delay) for end users can degrade under differential pricing schemes. In the oligopolistic market with multiple ISPs, users tend to select the ISP with lowest ISP resulting in same type of conclusions as in the monopolistic market. We then study how differential pricing effects the revenue of ISPs.",1393,2017,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,8.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09334v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09334v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09334v2,1709.09334v2

Endogeneity is due to unobservable individual characteristics that influence both link formation in the network and the outcome of interest. We propose two estimators of the peer effect equation that control for the endogeneity of the social connections using a control function approach.

Forecasting with Dynamic Panel Data Models,"Laura Liu, Hyungsik Roger Moon, Frank Schorfheide",3,This paper considers the problem of forecasting a collection of short time series using cross sectional information in panel data. We construct point predictors using Tweedie's formula for the posterior mean of heterogeneous coefficients under a correlated random effects distribution. This formula utilizes cross-sectional information to transform the unit-specific (quasi) maximum likelihood estimator into an approximation of the posterior mean under a prior distribution that equals the population distribution of the random coefficients. We show that the risk of a predictor based on a non-parametric estimate of the Tweedie correction is asymptotically equivalent to the risk of a predictor that treats the correlated-random-effects distribution as known (ratio-optimality). Our empirical Bayes predictor performs well compared to various competitors in a Monte Carlo study. In an empirical application we use the predictor to forecast revenues for a large panel of bank holding companies and compare forecasts that condition on actual and severely adverse macroeconomic conditions.,1088,2017,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,8.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10193v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.10193v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10193v1,1709.10193v1

Most methods that have been used to construct pointwise coverage bands for impulse responses of sign-restricted SVARs are justified only from a Bayesian perspective. This paper demonstrates how to formulate the inference problem for sign-restricted SVARs within a moment-inequality framework.

Rate-Optimal Estimation of the Intercept in a Semiparametric Sample-Selection Model,Chuan Goh,1,"This paper presents a new estimator of the intercept of a linear regression model in cases where the outcome varaible is observed subject to a selection rule. The intercept is often in this context of inherent interest; for example, in a program evaluation context, the difference between the intercepts in outcome equations for participants and non-participants can be interpreted as the difference in average outcomes of participants and their counterfactual average outcomes if they had chosen not to participate. The new estimator can under mild conditions exhibit a rate of convergence in probability equal to $n^{-p/(2p+1)}$, where $p\ge 2$ is an integer that indexes the strength of certain smoothness assumptions. This rate of convergence is shown in this context to be the optimal rate of convergence for estimation of the intercept parameter in terms of a minimax criterion. The new estimator, unlike other proposals in the literature, is under mild conditions consistent and asymptotically normal with a rate of convergence that is the same regardless of the degree to which selection depends on unobservables in the outcome equation.

We provide nonparametric identification results in a single large network setting for the potentially nonparametric homophily effect function, the realizations of unobserved individual fixed effects and the unknown distribution of idiosyncratic pairwise shocks, up to normalization, for each possible true value of the unknown parameters. We propose a novel form of scale normalization on an arbitrary interquantile range, which is not only theoretically robust but also proves particularly convenient for the identification analysis, as quantiles provide direct linkages between the observable conditional probabilities and the unknown index values. We then use an inductive ""in-fill and out-expansion"" algorithm to establish our main results, and consider extensions to more general settings that allow nonseparable dependence between homophily and degree heterogeneity, as well as certain extents of network sparsity and weaker assumptions on the support of unobserved heterogeneity.

Equity in Startups,Hervé Lebret,1,"Startups have become in less than 50 years a major component of innovation and economic growth. An important feature of the startup phenomenon has been the wealth created through equity in startups to all stakeholders. These include the startup founders, the investors, and also the employees through the stock-option mechanism and universities through licenses of intellectual property. In the employee group, the allocation to important managers like the chief executive, vice-presidents and other officers, and independent board members is also analyzed. This report analyzes how equity was allocated in more than 400 startups, most of which had filed for an initial public offering.

Identifying the Effects of a Program Offer with an Application to Head Start,Vishal Kamat,1,"I propose a treatment selection model that introduces unobserved heterogeneity in both choice sets and preferences to evaluate the average effects of a program offer. I show how to exploit the model structure to define parameters capturing these effects and then computationally characterize their identified sets under instrumental variable variation in choice sets. I illustrate these tools by analyzing the effects of providing an offer to the Head Start preschool program using data from the Head Start Impact Study. I find that such a policy affects a large number of children who take up the offer, and that they subsequently have positive effects on test scores. These effects arise from children who do not have any preschool as an outside option. A cost-benefit analysis reveals that the earning benefits associated with the test score gains can be large and outweigh the net costs associated with offer take up.",921,2017,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,8.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02048v6,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02048v6.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02048v6,1711.02048v6
Identification and Estimation of Spillover Effects in Randomized Experiments,Gonzalo Vazquez-Bare,1,"I study identification, estimation and inference for spillover effects in experiments where units' outcomes may depend on the treatment assignments of other units within a group. I show that the commonly-used reduced-form linear-in-means regression identifies a weighted sum of spillover effects with some negative weights, and that the difference in means between treated and controls identifies a combination of direct and spillover effects entering with different signs. I propose nonparametric estimators for average direct and spillover effects that overcome these issues and are consistent and asymptotically normal under a precise relationship between the number of parameters of interest, the total sample size and the treatment assignment mechanism. These findings are illustrated using data from a conditional cash transfer program and with simulations. The empirical results reveal the potential pitfalls of failing to flexibly account for spillover effects in policy evaluation: the estimated difference in means and the reduced-form linear-in-means coefficients are all close to zero and statistically insignificant, whereas the nonparametric estimators I propose reveal large, nonlinear and significant spillover effects.",1235,2017,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,8.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02745v8,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02745v8.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02745v8,1711.02745v8
Measuring Price Discovery between Nearby and Deferred Contracts in Storable and Non-Storable Commodity Futures Markets,"Zhepeng Hu, Mindy Mallory, Teresa Serra, Philip Garcia",4,"Futures market contracts with varying maturities are traded concurrently and the speed at which they process information is of value in understanding the pricing discovery process. Using price discovery measures, including Putnins (2013) information leadership share and intraday data, we quantify the proportional contribution of price discovery between nearby and deferred contracts in the corn and live cattle futures markets. Price discovery is more systematic in the corn than in the live cattle market. On average, nearby contracts lead all deferred contracts in price discovery in the corn market, but have a relatively less dominant role in the live cattle market. In both markets, the nearby contract loses dominance when its relative volume share dips below 50%, which occurs about 2-3 weeks before expiration in corn and 5-6 weeks before expiration in live cattle. Regression results indicate that the share of price discovery is most closely linked to trading volume but is also affected, to far less degree, by time to expiration, backwardation, USDA announcements and market crashes. The effects of these other factors vary between the markets which likely reflect the difference in storability as well as other market-related characteristics.",1257,2017,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,8.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03506v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.03506v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03506v1,1711.03506v1

Pradier, Viktor Stojkoski, Fernando Perez-Cruz, Ljupco Kocarev",5,"Economic complexity reflects the amount of knowledge that is embedded in the productive structure of an economy. It resides on the premise of hidden capabilities - fundamental endowments underlying the productive structure. In general, measuring the capabilities behind economic complexity directly is difficult, and indirect measures have been suggested which exploit the fact that the presence of the capabilities is expressed in a country's mix of products. We complement these studies by introducing a probabilistic framework which leverages Bayesian non-parametric techniques to extract the dominant features behind the comparative advantage in exported products. Based on economic evidence and trade data, we place a restricted Indian Buffet Process on the distribution of countries' capability endowment, appealing to a culinary metaphor to model the process of capability acquisition.

This decline from a mean of 257 minutes survives extensive spatial and demographic controls.

Set Identified Dynamic Economies and Robustness to Misspecification,Andreas Tryphonides,1,"We propose a new inferential methodology for dynamic economies that is robust to misspecification of the mechanism generating frictions. Economies with frictions are treated as perturbations of a frictionless economy that are consistent with a variety of mechanisms. We derive a representation for the law of motion for such economies and we characterize parameter set identification. We derive a link from model aggregate predictions to distributional information contained in qualitative survey data and specify conditions under which the identified set is refined. The latter is used to semi-parametrically estimate distortions due to frictions in macroeconomic variables. Based on these estimates, we propose a novel test for complete models. Using consumer and business survey data collected by the European Commission, we apply our method to estimate distortions due to financial frictions in the Spanish economy.

An existence theorem shows that the solution of an AR with a unit root of finite type is necessarily integrated of some finite integer $d$ and displays a common trends representation with a finite number of common stochastic trends of the type of (cumulated) bilateral random walks and an infinite dimensional cointegrating space. A characterization theorem clarifies the connections between the structure of the AR operators and $(i)$ the order of integration, $(ii)$ the structure of the attractor space and the cointegrating space, $(iii)$ the expression of the cointegrating relations, and $(iv)$ the Triangular representation of the process. Except for the fact that the number of cointegrating relations that are integrated of order 0 is infinite, the representation of $\mathcal{H}$-valued ARs with a unit root of finite type coincides with that of usual finite dimensional VARs, which corresponds to the special case $\mathcal{H}=\mathbb{R}^p$.",1263,2017,Econom.

Simultaneous Confidence Intervals for High-dimensional Linear Models with Many Endogenous Variables,"Alexandre Belloni, Christian Hansen, Whitney Newey",3,"High-dimensional linear models with endogenous variables play an increasingly important role in recent econometric literature.

Because of the high-dimensionality in the second stage, constructing honest confidence regions with asymptotically correct coverage is non-trivial. Our main contribution is to propose estimators and confidence regions that would achieve that. The approach relies on moment conditions that have an additional orthogonal property with respect to nuisance parameters. Moreover, estimation of high-dimension nuisance parameters is carried out via new pivotal procedures.

We propose and theoretically show that introducing prosocial incentives in the competitive environment is effective and robust to public observability since (i) it induces women who are intrinsically motivated by prosocial incentives to the competitive environment and (ii) it makes participating in a competition not costly for women from social image point of view. We conduct a laboratory experiment where we randomly manipulate the public observability of decisions to compete and test our theoretical predictions.

We administered an online experiment to 1,714 medical students immediately after their participation in the medical residency match--a leading field application of strategy-proof market design. When placed in an analogous, incentivized matching task, we find that 23% of participants misrepresent their preferences. We explore the factors that predict preference misrepresentation, including cognitive ability, strategic positioning, overconfidence, expectations, advice, and trust. We discuss the implications of this behavior for the design of allocation mechanisms and the social welfare in markets that use them.",898,2018,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,7.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01990v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01990v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01990v2,1802.01990v2
Prediction of Shared Bicycle Demand with Wavelet Thresholding,"J. Christopher Westland, Jian Mou, Dafei Yin",3,"Consumers are creatures of habit, often periodic, tied to work, shopping and other schedules. We analyzed one month of data from the world's largest bike-sharing company to elicit demand behavioral cycles, initially using models from animal tracking that showed large customers fit an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model with demand peaks at periodicities of 7, 12, 24 hour and 7-days. Lorenz curves of bicycle demand showed that the majority of customer usage was infrequent, and demand cycles from time-series models would strongly overfit the data yielding unreliable models. Analysis of thresholded wavelets for the space-time tensor of bike-sharing contracts was able to compress the data into a 56-coefficient model with little loss of information, suggesting that bike-sharing demand behavior is exceptionally strong and regular. Improvements to predicted demand could be made by adjusting for 'noise' filtered by our model from air quality and weather information and demand from infrequent riders.",995,2018,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,7.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02683v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02683v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02683v1,1802.02683v1
A General Method for Demand Inversion,Lixiong Li,1,"This paper describes a numerical method to solve for mean product qualities which equates the real market share to the market share predicted by a discrete choice model. The method covers a general class of discrete choice model, including the pure characteristics model in Berry and Pakes(2007) and the random coefficient logit model in Berry et al.(1995) (hereafter BLP). The method transforms the original market share inversion problem to an unconstrained convex minimization problem, so that any convex programming algorithm can be used to solve the inversion. Moreover, such results also imply that the computational complexity of inverting a demand model should be no more than that of a convex programming problem. In simulation examples, I show the method outperforms the contraction mapping algorithm in BLP. I also find the method remains robust in pure characteristics models with near-zero market shares.",917,2018,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,7.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04444v3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04444v3.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04444v3,1802.04444v3
The dynamic impact of monetary policy on regional housing prices in the US: Evidence based on factor-augmented vector autoregressions,"Manfred M. Fischer, Florian Huber, Michael Pfarrhofer, Petra Staufer-Steinnocher",4,"In this study interest centers on regional differences in the response of housing prices to monetary policy shocks in the US. We address this issue by analyzing monthly home price data for metropolitan regions using a factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) model. Bayesian model estimation is based on Gibbs sampling with Normal-Gamma shrinkage priors for the autoregressive coefficients and factor loadings, while monetary policy shocks are identified using high-frequency surprises around policy announcements as external instruments. The empirical results indicate that monetary policy actions typically have sizeable and significant positive effects on regional housing prices, revealing differences in magnitude and duration.

On the iterated estimation of dynamic discrete choice games,"Federico A. Bugni, Jackson Bunting",2,"We study the asymptotic properties of a class of estimators of the structural parameters in dynamic discrete choice games. We consider K-stage policy iteration (PI) estimators, where K denotes the number of policy iterations employed in the estimation. This class nests several estimators proposed in the literature such as those in Aguirregabiria and Mira (2002, 2007), Pesendorfer and Schmidt-Dengler (2008), and Pakes et al. (2007). First, we establish that the K-PML estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal for all K. This complements findings in Aguirregabiria and Mira (2007), who focus on K=1 and K large enough to induce convergence of the estimator. Furthermore, we show under certain conditions that the asymptotic variance of the K-PML estimator can exhibit arbitrary patterns as a function of K. Second, we establish that the K-MD estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal for all K. For a specific weight matrix, the K-MD estimator has the same asymptotic distribution as the K-PML estimator. Our main result provides an optimal sequence of weight matrices for the K-MD estimator and shows that the optimally weighted K-MD estimator has an asymptotic distribution that is invariant to K. The invariance result is especially unexpected given the findings in Aguirregabiria and Mira (2007) for K-PML estimators. Our main result implies two new corollaries about the optimal 1-MD estimator (derived by Pesendorfer and Schmidt-Dengler (2008)). First, the optimal 1-MD estimator is optimal in the class of K-MD estimators. In other words, additional policy iterations do not provide asymptotic efficiency gains relative to the optimal 1-MD estimator. Second, the optimal 1-MD estimator is more or equally asymptotically efficient than any K-PML estimator for all K. Finally, the appendix provides appropriate conditions under which the optimal 1-MD estimator is asymptotically efficient.",1913,2018,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,7.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06665v4,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06665v4.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06665v4,1802.06665v4
Kernel Estimation for Panel Data with Heterogeneous Dynamics,"Ryo Okui, Takahide Yanagi",2,"This paper proposes nonparametric kernel-smoothing estimation for panel data to examine the degree of heterogeneity across cross-sectional units.

The dependence of the kernel estimator on bandwidth makes asymptotic bias of very high order affect the required condition on the relative magnitudes of the cross-sectional sample size (N) and the time-series length (T). In particular, it makes the condition on N and T stronger and more complicated than those typically observed in the long-panel literature without kernel smoothing.

Identifying the occurrence or non occurrence of cognitive bias in situations resembling the Monty Hall problem,"Fatemeh Borhani, Edward J.

The practical significance of that fact for economic decision making is uncertain because a departure from sound reasoning may, but does not necessarily, result in a ""cognitively biased"" outcome different from what sound reasoning would have produced. Criteria are derived here, applicable to both experimental and non-experimental situations, for heuristic reasoning in an inferential-puzzle situations to result, or not to result, in cognitively bias.

I show that the solution does not exist for the quadratic and the logarithmic objective functions analysed by Sims (2003, 2006).

Synthetic Control Methods and Big Data,Daniel Kinn,1,"Many macroeconomic policy questions may be assessed in a case study framework, where the time series of a treated unit is compared to a counterfactual constructed from a large pool of control units. I provide a general framework for this setting, tailored to predict the counterfactual by minimizing a tradeoff between underfitting (bias) and overfitting (variance). The framework nests recently proposed structural and reduced form machine learning approaches as special cases. Furthermore, difference-in-differences with matching and the original synthetic control are restrictive cases of the framework, in general not minimizing the bias-variance objective. Using simulation studies I find that machine learning methods outperform traditional methods when the number of potential controls is large or the treated unit is substantially different from the controls. Equipped with a toolbox of approaches, I revisit a study on the effect of economic liberalisation on economic growth. I find effects for several countries where no effect was found in the original study. Furthermore, I inspect how a systematically important bank respond to increasing capital requirements by using a large pool of banks to estimate the counterfactual.

An Note on Why Geographically Weighted Regression Overcomes Multidimensional-Kernel-Based Varying-Coefficient Model,Zihao Yuan,1,"It is widely known that geographically weighted regression(GWR) is essentially same as varying-coefficient model. In the former research about varying-coefficient model, scholars tend to use multidimensional-kernel-based locally weighted estimation(MLWE) so that information of both distance and direction is considered. However, when we construct the local weight matrix of geographically weighted estimation, distance among the locations in the neighbor is the only factor controlling the value of entries of weight matrix. In other word, estimation of GWR is distance-kernel-based. Thus, in this paper, under stationary and limited dependent data with multidimensional subscripts, we analyze the local mean squared properties of without any assumption of the form of coefficient functions and compare it with MLWE. According to the theoretical and simulation results, geographically-weighted locally linear estimation(GWLE) is asymptotically more efficient than MLWE.

A Nonparametric Approach to Measure the Heterogeneous Spatial Association: Under Spatial Temporal Data,Zihao Yuan,1,"Spatial association and heterogeneity are two critical areas in the research about spatial analysis, geography, statistics and so on. Though large amounts of outstanding methods has been proposed and studied, there are few of them tend to study spatial association under heterogeneous environment. Additionally, most of the traditional methods are based on distance statistic and spatial weighted matrix. However, in some abstract spatial situations, distance statistic can not be applied since we can not even observe the geographical locations directly. Meanwhile, under these circumstances, due to invisibility of spatial positions, designing of weight matrix can not absolutely avoid subjectivity. In this paper, a new entropy-based method, which is data-driven and distribution-free, has been proposed to help us investigate spatial association while fully taking the fact that heterogeneity widely exist. Specifically, this method is not bounded with distance statistic or weight matrix. Asymmetrical dependence is adopted to reflect the heterogeneity in spatial association for each individual and the whole discussion in this paper is performed on spatio-temporal data with only assuming stationary m-dependent over time.",1229,2018,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,7.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02334v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02334v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02334v2,1803.02334v2

How Smart Are `Water Smart Landscapes'?,"Christa Brelsford, Joshua K.

We analyze data from one of the longest-running ""cash for grass"" policies - the Southern Nevada Water Authority's Water Smart Landscapes program, where homeowners are paid to replace grass with xeric landscaping. We use a twelve year long panel dataset of monthly water consumption records for 300,000 households in Las Vegas, Nevada. Utilizing a panel difference-in-differences approach, we estimate the average water savings per square meter of turf removed. We find that participation in this program reduced the average treated household's consumption by 18 percent. We find no evidence that water savings degrade as the landscape ages, or that water savings per unit area are influenced by the value of the rebate.

This paper proposes a nonparametric test for unobserved heterogeneous treatment effects in a treatment effect model with a binary treatment assignment, allowing for individuals' self-selection to the treatment. Under the standard local average treatment effects assumptions, i.e., the no defiers condition, we derive testable model restrictions for the hypothesis of unobserved heterogeneous treatment effects. Also, we show that if the treatment outcomes satisfy a monotonicity assumption, these model restrictions are also sufficient. Then, we propose a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov-type test which is consistent and simple to implement. Monte Carlo simulations show that our test performs well in finite samples.

Testing Continuity of a Density via g-order statistics in the Regression Discontinuity Design,"Federico A. Bugni, Ivan A. Canay",2,"In the regression discontinuity design (RDD), it is common practice to assess the credibility of the design by testing the continuity of the density of the running variable at the cut-off, e.g., McCrary (2008). In this paper we propose an approximate sign test for continuity of a density at a point based on the so-called g-order statistics, and study its properties under two complementary asymptotic frameworks. In the first asymptotic framework, the number q of observations local to the cut-off is fixed as the sample size n diverges to infinity, while in the second framework q diverges to infinity slowly as n diverges to infinity. Under both of these frameworks, we show that the test we propose is asymptotically valid in the sense that it has limiting rejection probability under the null hypothesis not exceeding the nominal level. More importantly, the test is easy to implement, asymptotically valid under weaker conditions than those used by competing methods, and exhibits finite sample validity under stronger conditions than those needed for its asymptotic validity. In a simulation study, we find that the approximate sign test provides good control of the rejection probability under the null hypothesis while remaining competitive under the alternative hypothesis.

Causal Inference for Survival Analysis,Vikas Ramachandra,1,"In this paper, we propose the use of causal inference techniques for survival function estimation and prediction for subgroups of the data, upto individual units. Tree ensemble methods, specifically random forests were modified for this purpose. A real world healthcare dataset was used with about 1800 patients with breast cancer, which has multiple patient covariates as well as disease free survival days (DFS) and a death event binary indicator (y). We use the type of cancer curative intervention as the treatment variable (T=0 or 1, binary treatment case in our example). The algorithm is a 2 step approach. In step 1, we estimate heterogeneous treatment effects using a causalTree with the DFS as the dependent variable. Next, in step 2, for each selected leaf of the causalTree with distinctly different average treatment effect (with respect to survival), we fit a survival forest to all the patients in that leaf, one forest each for treatment T=0 as well as T=1 to get estimated patient level survival curves for each treatment (more generally, any model can be used at this step). Then, we subtract the patient level survival curves to get the differential survival curve for a given patient, to compare the survival function as a result of the 2 treatments. The path to a selected leaf also gives us the combination of patient features and their values which are causally important for the treatment effect difference at the leaf.",1443,2018,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,7.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08218v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08218v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08218v1,1803.08218v1

The distribution of education arises in equilibrium from a Bayesian game: workers, knowing the distribution of worker and firm types, invest in education prior to the matching process.

Varying Random Coefficient Models,Christoph Breunig,1,"This paper provides a new methodology to analyze unobserved heterogeneity when observed characteristics are modeled nonlinearly. The proposed model builds on varying random coefficients (VRC) that are determined by nonlinear functions of observed regressors and additively separable unobservables. This paper proposes a novel estimator of the VRC density based on weighted sieve minimum distance. The main example of sieve bases are Hermite functions which yield a numerically stable estimation procedure. This paper shows inference results that go beyond what has been shown in ordinary RC models. We provide in each case rates of convergence and also establish pointwise limit theory of linear functionals, where a prominent example is the density of potential outcomes. In addition, a multiplier bootstrap procedure is proposed to construct uniform confidence bands. A Monte Carlo study examines finite sample properties of the estimator and shows that it performs well even when the regressors associated to RC are far from being heavy tailed.

Shapley Value Methods for Attribution Modeling in Online Advertising,"Kaifeng Zhao, Seyed Hanif Mahboobi, Saeed R.

Estimating Dynamic Treatment Effects in Event Studies with Heterogeneous Treatment Effects,"Liyang Sun, Sarah Abraham",2,"To estimate the dynamic effects of an absorbing treatment, researchers often use two-way fixed effects regressions that include leads and lags of the treatment. We show that in settings with variation in treatment timing across units, the coefficient on a given lead or lag can be contaminated by effects from other periods, and apparent pretrends can arise solely from treatment effects heterogeneity. We propose an alternative estimator that is free of contamination, and illustrate the relative shortcomings of two-way fixed effects regressions with leads and lags through an empirical application.",601,2018,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,7.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05785v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05785v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05785v2,1804.05785v2
Revisiting the thermal and superthermal two-class distribution of incomes: A critical perspective,Markus P. A. Schneider,1,"This paper offers a two-pronged critique of the empirical investigation of the income distribution performed by physicists over the past decade. Their finding rely on the graphical analysis of the observed distribution of normalized incomes. Two central observations lead to the conclusion that the majority of incomes are exponentially distributed, but neither each individual piece of evidence nor their concurrent observation robustly proves that the thermal and superthermal mixture fits the observed distribution of incomes better than reasonable alternatives. A formal analysis using popular measures of fit shows that while an exponential distribution with a power-law tail provides a better fit of the IRS income data than the log-normal distribution (often assumed by economists), the thermal and superthermal mixture's fit can be improved upon further by adding a log-normal component. The economic implications of the thermal and superthermal distribution of incomes, and the expanded mixture are explored in the paper.",1030,2018,"Schneider, M.P.A. Eur. Phys. J.

Estimating Treatment Effects in Mover Designs,Peter Hull,1,"Researchers increasingly leverage movement across multiple treatments to estimate causal effects. While these ""mover regressions"" are often motivated by a linear constant-effects model, it is not clear what they capture under weaker quasi-experimental assumptions. I show that binary treatment mover regressions recover a convex average of four difference-in-difference comparisons and are thus causally interpretable under a standard parallel trends assumption. Estimates from multiple-treatment models, however, need not be causal without stronger restrictions on the heterogeneity of treatment effects and time-varying shocks. I propose a class of two-step estimators to isolate and combine the large set of difference-in-difference quasi-experiments generated by a mover design, identifying mover average treatment effects under conditional-on-covariate parallel trends and effect homogeneity restrictions. I characterize the efficient estimators in this class and derive specification tests based on the model's overidentifying restrictions. Future drafts will apply the theory to the Finkelstein et al.

We present a strategy for selecting forecast models of call arrivals which is based on three pillars: (i) flexibility of the loss function; (ii) statistical evaluation of forecast accuracy; (iii) economic evaluation of forecast performance using money metrics. We implement fourteen time series models and seven forecast combination schemes on three series of daily call arrivals. Although we focus mainly on point forecasts, we also analyze density forecast evaluation.

Economic inequality and Islamic Charity: An exploratory agent-based modeling approach,"Hossein Sabzian, Alireza Aliahmadi, Adel Azar, Madjid Mirzaee",4,"Economic inequality is one of the pivotal issues for most of economic and social policy makers across the world to insure the sustainable economic growth and justice. In the mainstream school of economics, namely neoclassical theories, economic issues are dealt with in a mechanistic manner. Such a mainstream framework is majorly focused on investigating a socio-economic system based on an axiomatic scheme where reductionism approach plays a vital role. The major limitations of such theories include unbounded rationality of economic agents, reducing the economic aggregates to a set of predictable factors and lack of attention to adaptability and the evolutionary nature of economic agents. In tackling deficiencies of conventional economic models, in the past two decades, some new approaches have been recruited. One of those novel approaches is the Complex adaptive systems (CAS) framework which has shown a very promising performance in action. In contrast to mainstream school, under this framework, the economic phenomena are studied in an organic manner where the economic agents are supposed to be both boundedly rational and adaptive. According to it, the economic aggregates emerge out of the ways agents of a system decide and interact. As a powerful way of modeling CASs, Agent-based models (ABMs) has found a growing application among academicians and practitioners. ABMs show that how simple behavioral rules of agents and local interactions among them at micro-scale can generate surprisingly complex patterns at macro-scale. In this paper, ABMs have been used to show (1) how an economic inequality emerges in a system and to explain (2) how sadaqah as an Islamic charity rule can majorly help alleviating the inequality and how resource allocation strategies taken by charity entities can accelerate this alleviation.",1840,2018,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,7.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09284v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09284v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09284v1,1804.09284v1

Above this value, the marginal effect of aid is 0.69 points, ""all things being equal to otherwise"". One of the main contribution of this paper is to show that WAEMU countries need investments that could be covered by the foreign aid.

Optimal Linear Instrumental Variables Approximations,"Juan Carlos Escanciano, Wei Li",2,"This paper studies the identification and estimation of the optimal linear approximation of a structural regression function. The parameter in the linear approximation is called the Optimal Linear Instrumental Variables Approximation (OLIVA). This paper shows that a necessary condition for standard inference on the OLIVA is also sufficient for the existence of an IV estimand in a linear model. The instrument in the IV estimand is unknown and may not be identified. A Two-Step IV (TSIV) estimator based on Tikhonov regularization is proposed, which can be implemented by standard regression routines. We establish the asymptotic normality of the TSIV estimator assuming neither completeness nor identification of the instrument. As an important application of our analysis, we robustify the classical Hausman test for exogeneity against misspecification of the linear structural model. We also discuss extensions to weighted least squares criteria. Monte Carlo simulations suggest an excellent finite sample performance for the proposed inferences.

This class of models includes as particular cases important economic applications such as models of market entry-exit, occupational choice, machine replacement, inventory and investment decisions, or dynamic demand of differentiated products. The identification of structural parameters requires a sufficient statistic that controls for unobserved heterogeneity not only in current utility but also in the continuation value of the forward-looking decision problem.

Density Forecasts in Panel Data Models: A Semiparametric Bayesian Perspective,Laura Liu,1,"This paper constructs individual-specific density forecasts for a panel of firms or households using a dynamic linear model with common and heterogeneous coefficients as well as cross-sectional heteroskedasticity. The panel considered in this paper features a large cross-sectional dimension N but short time series T. Due to the short T, traditional methods have difficulty in disentangling the heterogeneous parameters from the shocks, which contaminates the estimates of the heterogeneous parameters. To tackle this problem, I assume that there is an underlying distribution of heterogeneous parameters, model this distribution nonparametrically allowing for correlation between heterogeneous parameters and initial conditions as well as individual-specific regressors, and then estimate this distribution by combining information from the whole panel. Theoretically, I prove that in cross-sectional homoskedastic cases, both the estimated common parameters and the estimated distribution of the heterogeneous parameters achieve posterior consistency, and that the density forecasts asymptotically converge to the oracle forecast. Methodologically, I develop a simulation-based posterior sampling algorithm specifically addressing the nonparametric density estimation of unobserved heterogeneous parameters.

Data-Driven Investment Decision-Making: Applying Moore's Law and S-Curves to Business Strategies,"Christopher L. Benson, Christopher L. Magee",2,"This paper introduces a method for linking technological improvement rates (i.e. Moore's Law) and technology adoption curves (i.e. S-Curves). There has been considerable research surrounding Moore's Law and the generalized versions applied to the time dependence of performance for other technologies. The prior work has culminated with methodology for quantitative estimation of technological improvement rates for nearly any technology. This paper examines the implications of such regular time dependence for performance upon the timing of key events in the technological adoption process. We propose a simple crossover point in performance which is based upon the technological improvement rates and current level differences for target and replacement technologies. The timing for the cross-over is hypothesized as corresponding to the first 'knee'? in the technology adoption ""S-curve"" and signals when the market for a given technology will start to be rewarding for innovators. This is also when potential entrants are likely to intensely experiment with product-market fit and when the competition to achieve a dominant design begins. This conceptual framework is then back-tested by examining two technological changes brought about by the internet, namely music and video transmission. The uncertainty analysis around the cases highlight opportunities for organizations to reduce future technological uncertainty. Overall, the results from the case studies support the reliability and utility of the conceptual framework in strategic business decision-making with the caveat that while technical uncertainty is reduced, it is not eliminated.",1652,2018,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,7.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06339v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06339v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06339v1,1805.06339v1

In this paper we investigate how successful this approach is in determining the correct model for different data generating processes using time series data. An alternative approach based on more formal model selection techniques using an information criterion or cross-validation is suggested and evaluated in the time series environment via Monte Carlo experiments.

The paper develops the corresponding asymptotic theory and provides simulation evidence that tilting substantially reduces the mean squared error for parameter estimates. It applies the methodology to pricing long-run risks in aggregate consumption in the US, whereas the model is solved using the Campbell and Shiller (1988) approximation.

Estimation of the PRTE involves estimation of multiple preliminary parameters, including propensity scores, conditional expectation functions of the outcome and covariates given the propensity score, and marginal treatment effects. These preliminary estimators can affect the asymptotic distribution of the PRTE estimator in complicated and intractable manners. In this light, we propose an orthogonal score for double debiased estimation of the PRTE, whereby the asymptotic distribution of the PRTE estimator is obtained without any influence of preliminary parameter estimators as far as they satisfy mild requirements of convergence rates.

Furthermore, the proposed bootstrap is robust to model misspecification, i.e., it achieves asymptotic refinements regardless of whether the assumed moment condition model is correctly specified or not. This result is new, because asymptotic refinements of the bootstrap based on these estimators have not been established in the literature even under correct model specification. Monte Carlo experiments are conducted in dynamic panel data setting to support the theoretical finding. As an application, bootstrap confidence intervals for the returns to schooling of Hellerstein and Imbens (1999) are calculated.

Quasi-Experimental Shift-Share Research Designs,"Kirill Borusyak, Peter Hull, Xavier Jaravel",3,"Many studies use shift-share (or ``Bartik'') instruments, which average a set of shocks with exposure share weights. We provide a new econometric framework for shift-share instrumental variable (SSIV) regressions in which identification follows from the quasi-random assignment of shocks, while exposure shares are allowed to be endogenous. The framework is motivated by an equivalence result: the orthogonality between a shift-share instrument and an unobserved residual can be represented as the orthogonality between the underlying shocks and a shock-level unobservable. SSIV regression coefficients can similarly be obtained from an equivalent shock-level regression, motivating shock-level conditions for their consistency.

The Impact of Supervision and Incentive Process in Explaining Wage Profile and Variance,"Nitsa Kasir, Idit Sohlberg",2,"The implementation of a supervision and incentive process for identical workers may lead to wage variance that stems from employer and employee optimization. The harder it is to assess the nature of the labor output, the more important such a process becomes, and the influence of such a process on wage development growth. The dynamic model presented in this paper shows that an employer will choose to pay a worker a starting wage that is less than what he deserves, resulting in a wage profile that fits the classic profile in the human-capital literature. The wage profile and wage variance rise at times of technological advancements, which leads to increased turnover as older workers are replaced by younger workers due to a rise in the relative marginal cost of the former.",781,2018,"Bank of Israel ,Discussion Paper Series, 2003",arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,7.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01332v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01332v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01332v1,1806.01332v1
Asymptotic Refinements of a Misspecification-Robust Bootstrap for Generalized Method of Moments Estimators,Seojeong Lee,1,"I propose a nonparametric iid bootstrap that achieves asymptotic refinements for t tests and confidence intervals based on GMM estimators even when the model is misspecified. In addition, my bootstrap does not require recentering the moment function, which has been considered as critical for GMM. Regardless of model misspecification, the proposed bootstrap achieves the same sharp magnitude of refinements as the conventional bootstrap methods which establish asymptotic refinements by recentering in the absence of misspecification. The key idea is to link the misspecified bootstrap moment condition to the large sample theory of GMM under misspecification of Hall and Inoue (2003).

A Consistent Variance Estimator for 2SLS When Instruments Identify Different LATEs,Seojeong Lee,1,"Under treatment effect heterogeneity, an instrument identifies the instrument-specific local average treatment effect (LATE). With multiple instruments, two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimand is a weighted average of different LATEs. What is often overlooked in the literature is that the postulated moment condition evaluated at the 2SLS estimand does not hold unless those LATEs are the same. If so, the conventional heteroskedasticity-robust variance estimator would be inconsistent, and 2SLS standard errors based on such estimators would be incorrect. I derive the correct asymptotic distribution, and propose a consistent asymptotic variance estimator by using the result of Hall and Inoue (2003, Journal of Econometrics) on misspecified moment condition models.

Leave-out estimation of variance components,"Patrick Kline, Raffaele Saggio, Mikkel Sølvsten",3,"We propose leave-out estimators of quadratic forms designed for the study of linear models with unrestricted heteroscedasticity. Applications include analysis of variance and tests of linear restrictions in models with many regressors. An approximation algorithm is provided that enables accurate computation of the estimator in very large datasets. We study the large sample properties of our estimator allowing the number of regressors to grow in proportion to the number of observations. Consistency is established in a variety of settings where plug-in methods and estimators predicated on homoscedasticity exhibit first-order biases. For quadratic forms of increasing rank, the limiting distribution can be represented by a linear combination of normal and non-central $\chi^2$ random variables, with normality ensuing under strong identification. Standard error estimators are proposed that enable tests of linear restrictions and the construction of uniformly valid confidence intervals for quadratic forms of interest. We find in Italian social security records that leave-out estimates of a variance decomposition in a two-way fixed effects model of wage determination yield substantially different conclusions regarding the relative contribution of workers, firms, and worker-firm sorting to wage inequality than conventional methods.

A Quantitative Analysis of Possible Futures of Autonomous Transport,"Christopher L. Benson, Pranav D Sumanth, Alina P Colling",3,"Autonomous ships (AS) used for cargo transport have gained a considerable amount of attention in recent years. They promise benefits such as reduced crew costs, increased safety and increased flexibility. This paper explores the effects of a faster increase in technological performance in maritime shipping achieved by leveraging fast-improving technological domains such as computer processors, and advanced energy storage. Based on historical improvement rates of several modes of transport (Cargo Ships, Air, Rail, Trucking) a simplified Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) simulation of an intermodal transport model (IMTM) is used to explore the effects of differing technological improvement rates for AS. The results show that the annual improvement rates of traditional shipping (Ocean Cargo Ships = 2.6%, Air Cargo = 5.5%, Trucking = 0.6%, Rail = 1.9%, Inland Water Transport = 0.4%) improve at lower rates than technologies associated with automation such as Computer Processors (35.6%), Fuel Cells (14.7%) and Automotive Autonomous Hardware (27.9%). The IMTM simulations up to the year 2050 show that the introduction of any mode of autonomous transport will increase competition in lower cost shipping options, but is unlikely to significantly alter the overall distribution of transport mode costs. Secondly, if all forms of transport end up converting to autonomous systems, then the uncertainty surrounding the improvement rates yields a complex intermodal transport solution involving several options, all at a much lower cost over time. Ultimately, the research shows a need for more accurate measurement of current autonomous transport costs and how they are changing over time.",1693,2018,,arXiv Econometrics,0,0,0,0,7.5,Econometrics,econ.EM,https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01696v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01696v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01696v1,1806.01696v1

This second-order system is shown to have a power self-trapping transition at a critical power greater than the third-order susceptibility coupler. Next, we consider a mixed coupler composed of a second-order guide coupled to a third-order guide and show that, although it does not display a rigorous self-trapping transition, for a particular choice of parameters it does show a fairly abrupt trapping of power at a lower power than in the third-order coupler. By coupling this mixed nonlinear pair to a third, purely linear guide, the power trapping can be brought to even lower levels and in this way a satisfactory switching profile can be achieved at less than one sixth the input power needed in the Jensen coupler.",1071,1997,"IEEE J. of Quantum Electronics, vol. 33, 336 (1997)",arXiv Optics and Photonics,0,0,0,0,28.5,Optics and Photonics,physics.optics,https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9704005v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9704005v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9704005v1,physics/9704005v1

Space-Time Approach to Scattering from Many Body Systems,"R. Gaehler, J. Felber, F. Mezei, R. Golub",4,"We present scattering from many body systems in a new light. In place of the usual van Hove treatment, (applicable to a wide range of scattering processes using both photons and massive particles) based on plane waves, we calculate the scattering amplitude as a space-time integral over the scattering sample for an incident wave characterized by its correlation function which results from the shaping of the wave field by the apparatus. Instrument resolution effects - seen as due to the loss of correlation caused by the path differences in the different arms of the instrument are automatically included and analytic forms of the resolution function for different instruments are obtained. The intersection of the moving correlation volumes (those regions where the correlation functions are significant) associated with the different elements of the apparatus determines the maximum correlation lengths (times) that can be observed in a sample, and hence, the momentum (energy) resolution of the measurement. This geometrical picture of moving correlation volumes derived by our technique shows how the interaction of the scatterer with the wave field shaped by the apparatus proceeds in space and time. Matching of the correlation volumes so as to maximize the intersection region yields a transparent, graphical method of instrument design.

Windenberger",2,"We study a generalized notion of two-mode squeezing for the Stokes and anti-Stokes fields in a model of a cavity Raman laser, which leads to a significant reduction in decoherence or quantum noise. The model comprises a loss-less cavity with classical pump, unsaturated medium and arbitrary homogeneous broadening and dispersion. Allowing for arbitrary linear combinations of the two modes in the definition of quadrature variables, we find that there always exists a combination of the two output modes which exhibits quadrature squeezing with noise reduction below the vacuum level. The number of noise photons for this combination mode is proportional to the square root of the number of Stokes noise photons.",712,1998,,arXiv Optics and Photonics,0,0,0,0,27.5,Optics and Photonics,physics.optics,https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9808022v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9808022v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9808022v1,physics/9808022v1

Dynamics of Fabry-Perot resonators with suspended mirrors. I. Nonlinear coupled oscillators,"M. Rakhmanov, A. Arodzero",2,"The dynamics of Fabry-Perot cavity with suspended mirrors is described. The suspended mirrors are nonlinear oscillators interacting with each other through the laser circulating in the cavity. The degrees of freedom decouple in normal coordinates, which are the position of the center of mass and the length of the cavity. We introduce two parameters and study how the dynamics changes with respect to these parameters. The first parameter specifies how strong the radiation pressure is. It determines whether the cavity is multistable or not. The second parameter is the control parameter, which determines location of the cavity equilibrium states. The equilibrium state shows hysteresis if the control parameter varies within a wide range. We analyze stability of the equilibrium states and identify the instability region. The instability is explained in terms of the effective potential: the stable states correspond to local minima of the effective potential and unstable states correspond to local maxima. The minima of the effective potential defines the resonant frequencies for the oscillations of the cavity length. We find the frequencies, and analyze how to tune them. Multistability of the cavity with a feedback control system is analyzed in terms of the servo potential.

Ognev,1,The effect of capture of X-ray beam into narrow submicron capillary was investigated with account for diffraction and decay of coherency by roughness scattering in transitional boundary layer. In contrast to well-known Andronov-Leontovich approach the losses do not vanish at zero gliding angle and scale proportional to the first power of roughness amplitude for small gliding angles. It was shown that for small correlation radius of roughness the scattering decay of coherency can be made of the same order as absorption decay of lower channeling modes to produce angular collimation of X-ray beams.

Quantum mechanics predicts that this limit can be exceeded, making it nonlocal. We analyse the effect of an environment modelled by a fluctuating magnetic field on the quantum correlations in an EPR singlet as seen in the Bell inequality. We show that in an EPR setup, the system goes from the usual 'violation' of Bell inequality to a 'non-violation' for times larger than a characteristic time scale which is related to the parameters of the fluctuating field.

Analysis of the Stern-Gerlach Measurement,"A. Venugopalan, Deepak Kumar, R. Ghosh",3,"A dynamical model for the collapse of the wave function in a quantum measurement process is proposed by considering the interaction of a quantum system (spin-1/2) with a macroscopic quantum apparatus interacting with an environment in a dissipative manner. The dissipative interaction leads to decoherence in the superposition states of the apparatus, making its behaviour classical in the sense that the density matrix becomes diagonal with time. Since the apparatus is also interacting with the system, the probabilities of the diagonal density matrix are determined by the state vector of the system. We consider a Stern-Gerlach type model, where a spin- 1/2 particle is in an inhomogeneous magnetic field, the whole set up being in contact with a large environment. Here we find that the density matrix of the combined system and apparatus becomes diagonal and the momentum of the particle becomes correlated with a spin operator, selected by the choice of the system-apparatus interaction. This allows for a measurement of spin via a momentum measurement on the particle with associated probabilities in accordance with quantum principles.",1144,1995,,arXiv Quantum Physics,0,0,0,0,30.5,Quantum Physics,quant-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9501022v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9501022v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9501022v1,quant-ph/9501022v1

"Conditional probabilities in quantum theory, and the tunneling time controversy",Aephraim M. Steinberg,1,"It is argued that there is a sensible way to define conditional probabilities in quantum mechanics, assuming only Bayes's theorem and standard quantum theory. These probabilities are equivalent to the ``weak measurement'' predictions due to Aharonov {\it et al.}, and hence describe the outcomes of real measurements made on subensembles. In particular, this approach is used to address the question of the history of a particle which has tunnelled across a barrier. A {\it gedankenexperiment} is presented to demonstrate the physically testable implications of the results of these calculations, along with graphs of the time-evolution of the conditional probability distribution for a tunneling particle and for one undergoing allowed transmission. Numerical results are also presented for the effects of loss in a bandgap medium on transmission and on reflection, as a function of the position of the lossy region; such loss should provide a feasible, though indirect, test of the present conclusions. It is argued that the effects of loss on the pulse {\it delay time} are related to the imaginary value of the momentum of a tunneling particle, and it is suggested that this might help explain a small discrepancy in an earlier experiment.",1243,1995,"Phys.Rev.A52:32-42,1995",arXiv Quantum Physics,0,0,0,0,30.5,Quantum Physics,quant-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9502003v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9502003v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9502003v1,quant-ph/9502003v1

Bell's inequalities and density matrices. Revealing hidden nonlocality.,Sandu Popescu,1,"As is well known, quantum mechanical behavior cannot, in general, be simulated by a local hidden variables model. Most -if not all- the proofs of this incompatibility refer to the correlations which arise when each of two (or more) systems separated in space is subjected to a single ideal measurement. This setting is good enough to show contradictions between local hidden variables models and quantum mechanics in the case of pure states. However, as shown here, it is not powerful enough in the case of mixtures. This is illustrated by an example. In this example, the correlations which arise when each of two systems separated in space is subjected to a single ideal measurement are classical; only when each system is subjected to a {\it sequence} of ideal measurements non-classical correlations are obtained. We also ask whether there are situations for which even this last procedure is not powerful enough and non-ideal measurements have to be considered as well.",974,1995,"Phys.Rev.Lett.74:2619-2622,1995",arXiv Quantum Physics,0,0,0,0,30.5,Quantum Physics,quant-ph,https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9502005v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9502005v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9502005v1,quant-ph/9502005v1

These remainder terms therefore vanish, relative to the distinguished term, in the appropriate macroscopic limits. This shows, in each order of the perturbative expansion, that quantum electrodynamics does indeed satisfy the pole-factorization and correspondence-principle requirements in the case treated here.

Since quantum information can exist as a coherent superposition of the classical ``yes'' and ``no'' states, certain tasks which are not conceivable in the classical setting can be performed in the quantum setting. Classical logical inconsistencies do not arise, since there exist fixed point states of the diagonalization operator. In particular, closed timelike curves need not be eliminated in the quantum setting, since they would not lead to any paradoxical outcome controllability.

Quantum Electrodynamics at Large Distances I: Extracting the Correspondence-Principle Part.,"Takahiro Kawai, Henry P. Stapp",2,"The correspondence principle is important in quantum theory on both the fundamental and practical levels: it is needed to connect theory to experiment, and for calculations in the technologically important domain lying between the atomic and classical regimes. Moreover, a correspondence-principle part of the S-matrix is normally separated out in quantum electrodynamics in order to obtain a remainder that can be treated perturbatively. But this separation, as usually performed, causes an apparent breakdown of the correspondence principle and the associated pole-factorization property. This breakdown is spurious. It is shown in this article, and a companion, in the context of a special case, how to extract a distinguished part of the S-matrix that meets the correspondence-principle and pole-factorization requirements. In a second companion paper the terms of the remainder are shown to vanish in the appropriate macroscopic limits.

It has been recently demonstrated that such computers can dramatically speed up the task of finding factors of large numbers -- a problem of great practical significance because of its cryptographic applications. Instead of the nearly exponential ($\sim \exp L^{1/3}$, for a number with $L$ digits) time required by the fastest classical algorithm, the quantum algorithm gives factors in a time polynomial in $L$ ($\sim L^2$). This enormous speed-up is possible in principle because quantum computation can simultaneously follow all of the paths corresponding to the distinct classical inputs, obtaining the solution as a result of coherent quantum interference between the alternatives. Hence, a quantum computer is sophisticated interference device, and it is essential for its quantum state to remain coherent in the course of the operation.

Rydberg Atoms Ionisation by Microwave Field and Electromagnetic Pulses,"B. Kaulakys, G.

Perelomov's SU(1,1) coherent states and the eigenstates of the SU(1,1) lowering generator (the Barut-Girardello states) are discussed. A recently developed formalism, based on the antinormal ordering of exponential phase operators, is used for studying phase properties and number-phase uncertainty relations. This study shows essential differences between properties of the Barut-Girardello states and the SU(1,1) coherent states. The philophase states, defined as states with simple phase-state representations, relate the quantum description of the optical phase to the properties of the SU(1,1) Lie group.

Consistent Quantum Reasoning,Robert B. Griffiths,1,"Precise rules are developed in order to formalize the reasoning processes involved in standard non-relativistic quantum mechanics, with the help of analogies from classical physics. A classical or quantum description of a mechanical system involves a {\it framework}, often chosen implicitly, and a {\it statement} or assertion about the system which is either true or false within the framework with which it is associated. Quantum descriptions are no less ``objective'' than their classical counterparts, but differ from the latter in the following respects: (i) The framework employs a Hilbert space rather than a classical phase space. (ii) The rules for constructing meaningful statements require that the associated projectors commute with each other and, in the case of time-dependent quantum histories, that consistency conditions be satisfied. (iii) There are incompatible frameworks which cannot be combined, either in constructing descriptions or in making logical inferences about them, even though any one of these frameworks may be used separately for describing a particular physical system.   A new type of ``generalized history'' is introduced which extends previous proposals by Omn\`es, and Gell-Mann and Hartle, and a corresponding consistency condition which does not involve density matrices or single out a direction of time.

On the Conditioning of the Spherical Harmonic Matrix for Spatial Audio Applications,"C Sandeep Reddy, Rajesh M Hegde",2,"In this paper, we attempt to study the conditioning of the Spherical Harmonic Matrix (SHM), which is widely used in the discrete, limited order orthogonal representation of sound fields. SHM's has been widely used in the audio applications like spatial sound reproduction using loudspeakers, orthogonal representation of Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) etc. The conditioning behaviour of the SHM depends on the sampling positions chosen in the 3D space. Identification of the optimal sampling points in the continuous 3D space that results in a well-conditioned SHM for any number of sampling points is a highly challenging task. In this work, an attempt has been made to solve a discrete version of the above problem using optimization based techniques. The discrete problem is, to identify the optimal sampling points from a discrete set of densely sampled positions of the 3D space, that minimizes the condition number of SHM. This method has been subsequently utilized for identifying the geometry of loudspeakers in the spatial sound reproduction, and in the selection of spatial sampling configurations for HRTF measurement. The application specific requirements have been formulated as additional constraints of the optimization problem. Recently developed mixed-integer optimization solvers have been used in solving the formulated problem. The performance of the obtained sampling position in each application is compared with the existing configurations. Objective measures like condition number, D-measure, and spectral distortion are used to study the performance of the sampling configurations resulting from the proposed and the existing methods. It is observed that the proposed solution is able to find the sampling points that results in a better conditioned SHM and also maintains all the application specific requirements.",1849,2017,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,8.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08633v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08633v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08633v2,1710.08633v2

Raga Identification using Repetitive Note Patterns from prescriptive notations of Carnatic Music,"Ranjani H. G., T. V. Sreenivas",2,"Carnatic music, a form of Indian Art Music, has relied on an oral tradition for transferring knowledge across several generations. Over the last two hundred years, the use of prescriptive notations has been adopted for learning, sight-playing and sight-singing. Prescriptive notations offer generic guidelines for a raga rendition and do not include information about the ornamentations or the gamakas, which are considered to be critical for characterizing a raga. In this paper, we show that prescriptive notations contain raga attributes and can reliably identify a raga of Carnatic music from its octave-folded prescriptive notations. We restrict the notations to 7 notes and suppress the finer note position information. A dictionary based approach captures the statistics of repetitive note patterns within a raga notation. The proposed stochastic models of repetitive note patterns (or SMRNP in short) obtained from raga notations of known compositions, outperforms the state of the art melody based raga identification technique on an equivalent melodic data corresponding to the same compositions.

But STE and ZCR based EPD algorithms often fail in the presence of Non-speech Sound Artifacts (NSAs) produced by the speakers. Algorithms based on pattern recognition and classification techniques are also proposed but require labeled data for training. A new algorithm termed as Wavelet Convolution based Speech Endpoint Detection (WCSEPD) is proposed in this article to extract speech endpoints. WCSEPD decomposes the speech signal into high-frequency and low-frequency components using wavelet convolution and computes entropy based thresholds for the two frequency components. The low-frequency thresholds are used to extract voiced speech segments, whereas the high-frequency thresholds are used to extract the unvoiced speech segments by filtering out the NSAs. WCSEPD does not require any labeled data for training and can automatically extract speech segments. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm precisely extracts speech endpoints in the presence of NSAs.",1347,2018,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,7.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06159v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06159v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06159v1,1804.06159v1
Simulating dysarthric speech for training data augmentation in clinical speech applications,"Yishan Jiao, Ming Tu, Visar Berisha, Julie Liss",4,"Training machine learning algorithms for speech applications requires large, labeled training data sets. This is problematic for clinical applications where obtaining such data is prohibitively expensive because of privacy concerns or lack of access. As a result, clinical speech applications are typically developed using small data sets with only tens of speakers. In this paper, we propose a method for simulating training data for clinical applications by transforming healthy speech to dysarthric speech using adversarial training. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach using both objective and subjective criteria. We present the transformed samples to five experienced speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and ask them to identify the samples as healthy or dysarthric. The results reveal that the SLPs identify the transformed speech as dysarthric 65% of the time. In a pilot classification experiment, we show that by using the simulated speech samples to balance an existing dataset, the classification accuracy improves by about 10% after data augmentation.",1069,2018,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,7.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10325v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10325v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10325v1,1804.10325v1
Angular Softmax Loss for End-to-end Speaker Verification,"Yutian Li, Feng Gao, Zhijian Ou, Jiasong Sun",4,"End-to-end speaker verification systems have received increasing interests. The traditional i-vector approach trains a generative model (basically a factor-analysis model) to extract i-vectors as speaker embeddings. In contrast, the end-to-end approach directly trains a discriminative model (often a neural network) to learn discriminative speaker embeddings; a crucial component is the training criterion. In this paper, we use angular softmax (A-softmax), which is originally proposed for face verification, as the loss function for feature learning in end-to-end speaker verification. By introducing margins between classes into softmax loss, A-softmax can learn more discriminative features than softmax loss and triplet loss, and at the same time, is easy and stable for usage. We make two contributions in this work. 1) We introduce A-softmax loss into end-to-end speaker verification and achieve significant EER reductions. 2) We find that the combination of using A-softmax in training the front-end and using PLDA in the back-end scoring further boosts the performance of end-to-end systems under short utterance condition (short in both enrollment and test). Experiments are conducted on part of $Fisher$ dataset and demonstrate the improvements of using A-softmax.",1276,2018,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,7.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03464v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03464v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03464v2,1806.03464v2
RTF-Based Binaural MVDR Beamformer Exploiting an External Microphone in a Diffuse Noise Field,"N. Gößling, S. Doclo",2,"Besides suppressing all undesired sound sources, an important objective of a binaural noise reduction algorithm for hearing devices is the preservation of the binaural cues, aiming at preserving the spatial perception of the acoustic scene. A well-known binaural noise reduction algorithm is the binaural minimum variance distortionless response beamformer, which can be steered using the relative transfer function (RTF) vector of the desired source, relating the acoustic transfer functions between the desired source and all microphones to a reference microphone. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient method to estimate the RTF vector in a diffuse noise field, requiring an additional microphone that is spatially separated from the head-mounted microphones. Assuming that the spatial coherence between the noise components in the head-mounted microphone signals and the additional microphone signal is zero, we show that an unbiased estimate of the RTF vector can be obtained. Based on real-world recordings, experimental results for several reverberation times show that the proposed RTF estimator outperforms the widely used RTF estimator based on covariance whitening and a simple biased RTF estimator in terms of noise reduction and binaural cue preservation performance.",1296,2018,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,7.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04096v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04096v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04096v2,1807.04096v2

By using a new update scheme called generalized iterative projection for homogeneous source models, we obtain a convergence-guaranteed update rule for demixing spatial parameters.

Advancing Multi-Accented LSTM-CTC Speech Recognition using a Domain Specific Student-Teacher Learning Paradigm,"Shahram Ghorbani, Ahmet E. Bulut, John H. L. Hansen",3,"Non-native speech causes automatic speech recognition systems to degrade in performance. Past strategies to address this challenge have considered model adaptation, accent classification with a model selection, alternate pronunciation lexicon, etc. In this study, we consider a recurrent neural network (RNN) with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) cost function trained on multi-accent English data including US (Native), Indian and Hispanic accents. We exploit dark knowledge from a model trained with the multi-accent data to train student models under the guidance of both a teacher model and CTC cost of target transcription. We show that transferring knowledge from a single RNN-CTC trained model toward a student model, yields better performance than the stand-alone teacher model. Since the outputs of different trained CTC models are not necessarily aligned, it is not possible to simply use an ensemble of CTC teacher models. To address this problem, we train accent specific models under the guidance of a single multi-accent teacher, which results in having multiple aligned and trained CTC models. Furthermore, we train a student model under the supervision of the accent-specific teachers, resulting in an even further complementary model, which achieves +20.1% relative Character Error Rate (CER) reduction compared to the baseline trained without any teacher. Having this effective multi-accent model, we can achieve further improvement for each accent by adapting the model to each accent. Using the accent specific model's outputs to regularize the adapting process (i.e., a knowledge distillation version of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence) results in even superior performance compared to the conventional approach using general teacher models.",1774,2018,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,7.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06833v3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06833v3.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06833v3,1809.06833v3

Error Reduction Network for DBLSTM-based Voice Conversion,"Mingyang Zhang, Berrak Sisman, Sai Sirisha Rallabandi, Haizhou Li, Li Zhao",5,"So far, many of the deep learning approaches for voice conversion produce good quality speech by using a large amount of training data. This paper presents a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (DBLSTM) based voice conversion framework that can work with a limited amount of training data. We propose to implement a DBLSTM based average model that is trained with data from many speakers. Then, we propose to perform adaptation with a limited amount of target data. Last but not least, we propose an error reduction network that can improve the voice conversion quality even further. The proposed framework is motivated by three observations. Firstly, DBLSTM can achieve a remarkable voice conversion by considering the long-term dependencies of the speech utterance. Secondly, DBLSTM based average model can be easily adapted with a small amount of data, to achieve a speech that sounds closer to the target. Thirdly, an error reduction network can be trained with a small amount of training data, and can improve the conversion quality effectively.

Concatenated Identical DNN (CI-DNN) to Reduce Noise-Type Dependence in DNN-Based Speech Enhancement,"Ziyi Xu, Maximilian Strake, Tim Fingscheidt",3,"Estimating time-frequency domain masks for speech enhancement using deep learning approaches has recently become a popular field of research. In this paper, we propose a mask-based speech enhancement framework by using concatenated identical deep neural networks (CI-DNNs). The idea is that a single DNN is trained under multiple input and output signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) conditions, using targets that provide a moderate SNR gain with respect to the input and therefore achieve a balance between speech component quality and noise suppression. We concatenate this single DNN several times without any retraining to provide enough noise attenuation. Simulation results show that our proposed CI-DNN outperforms enhancement methods using classical spectral weighting rules w.r.t. total speech quality and speech intelligibility. Moreover, our approach shows similar or even a little bit better performance with much fewer trainable parameters compared with a noisy-target single DNN approach of the same size. A comparison to the conventional clean-target single DNN approach shows that our proposed CI-DNN is better in speech component quality and much better in residual noise component quality. Most importantly, our new CI-DNN generalized best to an unseen noise type, if compared to the other tested deep learning approaches.",1338,2018,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,7.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11217v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11217v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11217v1,1810.11217v1

Trends in Internet-of-Things technology and development in personal digital assistants (PDAs) however begs us to consider future requirements for speech and audio codecs. The opportunities and challenges are here summarized in three concepts: collaboration, unification and privacy. First, an increasing number of devices will in the future be speech-operated, whereby the ability to focus voice commands to a specific devices becomes essential. We therefore need methods which allows collaboration between devices, such that ambiguities can be resolved. Second, such collaboration can be achieved with a unified and standardized communication protocol between voice-operated devices. To achieve such collaboration protocols, we need to develop distributed speech coding technology for ad-hoc IoT networks.

First we evaluate a linear (uniform) method applied to these styles as well as to naturally-produced fast speech. We found, in line with the literature, that unprocessed fast speech was less intelligible than linearly compressed normal speech. Fast speech was also less intelligible than compressed clear speech but at the highest rate (three times faster than normal) the advantage of clear over fast speech was lost. To test whether this was due to shorter speech duration we evaluate, in our second experiments, a range of methods that compress speech and silence at different rates. We found that even when the overall duration of speech and silence is kept the same across styles, compressed normal speech is still more intelligible than compressed clear speech.

Speaker Verification By Partial AUC Optimization With Mahalanobis Distance Metric Learning,"Zhongxin Bai, Xiao-Lei Zhang, Jingdong Chen",3,"Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and detection error tradeoff (DET) curves are two widely used evaluation metrics for speaker verification. They are equivalent since the latter can be obtained by transforming the former's true positive y-axis to false negative y-axis and then re-scaling both axes by a probit operator. Real-world speaker verification systems, however, usually work on part of the ROC curve instead of the entire ROC curve given an application. Therefore, we propose in this paper to use the area under part of the ROC curve (pAUC) as a more efficient evaluation metric for speaker verification. A Mahalanobis distance metric learning based back-end is applied to optimize pAUC, where the Mahalanobis distance metric learning guarantees that the optimization objective of the back-end is a convex one so that the global optimum solution is achievable. To improve the performance of the state-of-the-art speaker verification systems by the proposed back-end, we further propose two feature preprocessing techniques based on length-normalization and probabilistic linear discriminant analysis respectively. We evaluate the proposed systems on the major languages of NIST SRE16 and the core tasks of SITW.

Overlap-Add Windows with Maximum Energy Concentration for Speech and Audio Processing,Tom Bäckström,1,"Processing of speech and audio signals with time-frequency representations require windowing methods which allow perfect reconstruction of the original signal and where processing artifacts have a predictable behavior. The most common approach for this purpose is overlap-add windowing, where signal segments are windowed before and after processing. Commonly used windows include the half-sine and a Kaiser-Bessel derived window. The latter is an approximation of the discrete prolate spherical sequence, and thus a maximum energy concentration window, adapted for overlap-add. We demonstrate that performance can be improved by including the overlap-add structure as a constraint in optimization of the maximum energy concentration criteria. The same approach can be used to find further special cases such as optimal low-overlap windows.

Irrelevant speech effect in open plan offices: A laboratory study,"Krist Kostallari, Etienne Parizet, Patrick Chevret, Jean-Noël Amato, Edith Galy",5,"It seems now accepted that speech noise in open plan offices is the main source of discomfort for employees. This work follows a series of studies conducted at INRS France and INSA Lyon based on Hongisto's theoretical model (2005) linking the Decrease in Performance (DP) and the Speech Transmission Index (STI). This model predicts that for STI values between 0.7 and 1, which means a speech signal close to 100% of intelligibility, the DP remains constant at about 7%. The experiment that we carried out aimed to gather more information about the relation between DP and STI, varying the STI value up to 0.9. Fifty-five subjects between 25-59 years old participated in the experiment. First, some psychological parameters were observed in order to better characterize the inter-subjects variability. Then, subjects performed a Working-Memory (WM) task in silence and in four different sound conditions (STI from 0.25 to 0.9). This task was customized by an initial measure of mnemonic span so that two different cognitive loads (low/high) were equally defined for each subject around their span value. Subjects also subjectively evaluated their mental load and discomfort at the end of each WM task, for each noise condition. Results show a significant effect of the STI on the DP, the mental load and the discomfort. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the age of subjects and their performance during the WM task. This result was confirmed by a cluster analysis that enabled us to separate the subjects on two different groups, one group of younger and more efficient subjects and one group of older and less efficient subjects. General results did not show any increase of DP for the highest STI values, so the ""plateau"" hypothesis of Hongisto's model cannot be rejected on the basis of this experiment.",1829,2019,"24th INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON SOUND AND VIBRATION, Jul 2017,

This paper presents an end-to-end approach to automatic speech assessment for Cantonese-speaking People With Aphasia (PWA). The assessment is formulated as a binary classification task to discriminate PWA with high scores of subjective assessment from those with low scores. The sequence-to-one Recurrent Neural Network with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU-RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are applied to realize the end-to-end mapping from fundamental speech features to the classification result. The pathology-specific features used for assessment can be learned implicitly by the neural network model. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) method is utilized to visualize how those features contribute to the assessment result. Our experimental results show that the end-to-end approach outperforms the conventional two-step approach in the classification task, and confirm that the CNN model is able to learn impairment-related features that are similar to human-designed features.

Leveraging native language information for improved accented speech recognition,"Shahram Ghorbani, John H. L. Hansen",2,"Recognition of accented speech is a long-standing challenge for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, given the increasing worldwide population of bi-lingual speakers with English as their second language. If we consider foreign-accented speech as an interpolation of the native language (L1) and English (L2), using a model that can simultaneously address both languages would perform better at the acoustic level for accented speech. In this study, we explore how an end-to-end recurrent neural network (RNN) trained system with English and native languages (Spanish and Indian languages) could leverage data of native languages to improve performance for accented English speech. To this end, we examine pre-training with native languages, as well as multi-task learning (MTL) in which the main task is trained with native English and the secondary task is trained with Spanish or Indian Languages. We show that the proposed MTL model performs better than the pre-training approach and outperforms a baseline model trained simply with English data. We suggest a new setting for MTL in which the secondary task is trained with both English and the native language, using the same output set. This proposed scenario yields better performance with +11.95% and +17.55% character error rate gains over baseline for Hispanic and Indian accents, respectively.",1361,2019,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,6.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09038v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09038v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09038v1,1904.09038v1
Latent Class Model with Application to Speaker Diarization,"Liang He, Xianhong Chen, Can Xu, Yi Liu, Jia Liu, Michael T Johnson",6,"In this paper, we apply a latent class model (LCM) to the task of speaker diarization. LCM is similar to Patrick Kenny's variational Bayes (VB) method in that it uses soft information and avoids premature hard decisions in its iterations. In contrast to the VB method, which is based on a generative model, LCM provides a framework allowing both generative and discriminative models. The discriminative property is realized through the use of i-vector (Ivec), probabilistic linear discriminative analysis (PLDA), and a support vector machine (SVM) in this work. Systems denoted as LCM-Ivec-PLDA, LCM-Ivec-SVM, and LCM-Ivec-Hybrid are introduced. In addition, three further improvements are applied to enhance its performance. 1) Adding neighbor windows to extract more speaker information for each short segment. 2) Using a hidden Markov model to avoid frequent speaker change points. 3) Using an agglomerative hierarchical cluster to do initialization and present hard and soft priors, in order to overcome the problem of initial sensitivity. Experiments on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Rich Transcription 2009 speaker diarization database, under the condition of a single distant microphone, show that the diarization error rate (DER) of the proposed methods has substantial relative improvements compared with mainstream systems. Compared to the VB method, the relative improvements of LCM-Ivec-PLDA, LCM-Ivec-SVM, and LCM-Ivec-Hybrid systems are 23.5%, 27.1%, and 43.0%, respectively. Experiments on our collected database, CALLHOME97, CALLHOME00 and SRE08 short2-summed trial conditions also show that the proposed LCM-Ivec-Hybrid system has the best overall performance.",1698,2019,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,6.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11130v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.11130v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11130v1,1904.11130v1
Semi-Supervised Speech Emotion Recognition with Ladder Networks,"Srinivas Parthasarathy, Carlos Busso",2,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems find applications in various fields such as healthcare, education, and security and defense. A major drawback of these systems is their lack of generalization across different conditions. This problem can be solved by training models on large amounts of labeled data from the target domain, which is expensive and time-consuming. Another approach is to increase the generalization of the models. An effective way to achieve this goal is by regularizing the models through multitask learning (MTL), where auxiliary tasks are learned along with the primary task. These methods often require the use of labeled data which is computationally expensive to collect for emotion recognition (gender, speaker identity, age or other emotional descriptors). This study proposes the use of ladder networks for emotion recognition, which utilizes an unsupervised auxiliary task. The primary task is a regression problem to predict emotional attributes. The auxiliary task is the reconstruction of intermediate feature representations using a denoising autoencoder. This auxiliary task does not require labels so it is possible to train the framework in a semi-supervised fashion with abundant unlabeled data from the target domain. This study shows that the proposed approach creates a powerful framework for SER, achieving superior performance than fully supervised single-task learning (STL) and MTL baselines. The approach is implemented with several acoustic features, showing that ladder networks generalize significantly better in cross-corpus settings. Compared to the STL baselines, the proposed approach achieves relative gains in concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) between 3.0% and 3.5% for within corpus evaluations, and between 16.1% and 74.1% for cross corpus evaluations, highlighting the power of the architecture.",1864,2019,"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing,

Binaural LCMV Beamforming with Partial Noise Estimation,"Nico Gößling, Elior Hadad, Sharon Gannot, Simon Doclo",4,"Besides reducing undesired sources (interfering sources and background noise), another important objective of a binaural beamforming algorithm is to preserve the spatial impression of the acoustic scene, which can be achieved by preserving the binaural cues of all sound sources. While the binaural minimum variance distortionless response (BMVDR) beamformer provides a good noise reduction performance and preserves the binaural cues of the desired source, it does not allow to control the reduction of the interfering sources and distorts the binaural cues of the interfering sources and the background noise. Hence, several extensions have been proposed. First, the binaural linearly constrained minimum variance (BLCMV) beamformer uses additional constraints, enabling to control the reduction of the interfering sources while preserving their binaural cues. Second, the BMVDR with partial noise estimation (BMVDR-N) mixes the output signals of the BMVDR with the noisy reference microphone signals, enabling to control the binaural cues of the background noise. Merging the advantages of both extensions, in this paper we propose the BLCMV with partial noise estimation (BLCMV-N). We show that the output signals of the BLCMV-N can be interpreted as a mixture of the noisy reference microphone signals and the output signals of a BLCMV using an adjusted interference scaling parameter. We provide a theoretical comparison between the BMVDR, the BLCMV, the BMVDR-N and the proposed BLCMV-N in terms of noise and interference reduction performance and binaural cue preservation. Experimental results using recorded signals as well as the results of a perceptual listening test show that the BLCMV-N is able to preserve the binaural cues of an interfering source (like the BLCMV), while enabling to trade off between noise reduction performance and binaural cue preservation of the background noise (like the BMVDR-N).",1920,2019,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,6.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04050v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04050v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04050v2,1905.04050v2

This encouraging result in imitating the target styles led us to investigate if converted (synthetic) samples can be used to improve ASR training. Unfortunately, adding synthetic data to the ASR training set only marginally improves word and character error rates. Our results indicate that even though VC models can successfully mimic the style of target speakers as measured by SID systems, improving ASR training with synthetic data from VC systems needs further research to establish its efficacy.",853,2019,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,6.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12531v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12531v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12531v1,1905.12531v1

Localization Uncertainty in Time-Amplitude Stereophonic Reproduction,"Enzo De Sena, Zoran Cvetkovic, Huseyin Hacihabiboglu, Marc Moonen, Toon van Waterschoot",5,"This article studies the effects of inter-channel time and level differences in stereophonic reproduction on perceived localization uncertainty, which is defined as how difficult it is for a listener to tell where a sound source is located. Towards this end, a computational model of localization uncertainty is proposed first. The model calculates inter-aural time and level difference cues, and compares them to those associated to free-field point-like sources. The comparison is carried out using a particular distance functional that replicates the increased uncertainty observed experimentally with inconsistent inter-aural time and level difference cues. The model is validated by formal listening tests, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.99. The model is then used to predict localization uncertainty for stereophonic setups and a listener in central and off-central positions. Results show that amplitude methods achieve a slightly lower localization uncertainty for a listener positioned exactly in the center of the sweet spot. As soon as the listener moves away from that position, the situation reverses, with time-amplitude methods achieving a lower localization uncertainty.",1192,2019,"IEEE/ACM Trans.

Black-box Attacks on Automatic Speaker Verification using Feedback-controlled Voice Conversion,"Xiaohai Tian, Rohan Kumar Das, Haizhou Li",3,"Automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems in practice are greatly vulnerable to spoofing attacks. The latest voice conversion technologies are able to produce perceptually natural sounding speech that mimics any target speakers. However, the perceptual closeness to a speaker's identity may not be enough to deceive an ASV system. In this work, we propose a framework that uses the output scores of an ASV system as the feedback to a voice conversion system. The attacker framework is a black-box adversary that steals one's voice identity, because it does not require any knowledge about the ASV system but the system outputs. Experimental results conducted on ASVspoof 2019 database confirm that the proposed feedback-controlled voice conversion framework produces adversarial samples that are more deceptive than the straightforward voice conversion, thereby boosting the impostor ASV scores. Further, the perceptual evaluation studies reveal that converted speech does not adversely affect the voice quality from the baseline system.",1040,2019,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,6.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07655v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07655v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07655v2,1909.07655v2
A Modularized Neural Network with Language-Specific Output Layers for Cross-lingual Voice Conversion,"Yi Zhou, Xiaohai Tian, Emre Yılmaz, Rohan Kumar Das, Haizhou Li",5,"This paper presents a cross-lingual voice conversion framework that adopts a modularized neural network. The modularized neural network has a common input structure that is shared for both languages, and two separate output modules, one for each language. The idea is motivated by the fact that phonetic systems of languages are similar because humans share a common vocal production system, but acoustic renderings, such as prosody and phonotactic, vary a lot from language to language. The modularized neural network is trained to map Phonetic PosteriorGram (PPG) to acoustic features for multiple speakers. It is conditioned on a speaker i-vector to generate the desired target voice. We validated the idea between English and Mandarin languages in objective and subjective tests. In addition, mixed-lingual PPG derived from a unified English-Mandarin acoustic model is proposed to capture the linguistic information from both languages. It is found that our proposed modularized neural network significantly outperforms the baseline approaches in terms of speech quality and speaker individuality, and mixed-lingual PPG representation further improves the conversion performance.",1183,2019,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,6.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00496v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00496v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00496v1,1910.00496v1
Objective Human Affective Vocal Expression Detection and Automatic Classification with Stochastic Models and Learning Systems,"V. Vieira, R. Coelho, F. Assis",3,"This paper presents a widespread analysis of affective vocal expression classification systems. In this study, state-of-the-art acoustic features are compared to two novel affective vocal prints for the detection of emotional states: the Hilbert-Huang-Hurst Coefficients (HHHC) and the vector of index of non-stationarity (INS). HHHC is here proposed as a nonlinear vocal source feature vector that represents the affective states according to their effects on the speech production mechanism. Emotional states are highlighted by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based method, which exploits the non-stationarity of the affective acoustic variations. Hurst coefficients (closely related to the excitation source) are then estimated from the decomposition process to compose the feature vector. Additionally, the INS vector is introduced as dynamic information to the HHHC feature. The proposed features are evaluated in speech emotion classification experiments with three databases in German and English languages. Three state-of-the-art acoustic features are adopted as baseline. The $\alpha$-integrated Gaussian model ($\alpha$-GMM) is also introduced for the emotion representation and classification. Its performance is compared to competing stochastic and machine learning classifiers. Results demonstrate that HHHC leads to significant classification improvement when compared to the baseline acoustic features. Moreover, results also show that $\alpha$-GMM outperforms the competing classification methods. Finally, HHHC and INS are also evaluated as complementary features for the GeMAPS and eGeMAPS feature sets",1627,2019,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,6.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01967v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01967v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01967v1,1910.01967v1
Cross lingual transfer learning for zero-resource domain adaptation,"Alberto Abad, Peter Bell, Andrea Carmantini, Steve Renals",4,"We propose a method for zero-resource domain adaptation of DNN acoustic models, for use in low-resource situations where the only in-language training data available may be poorly matched to the intended target domain. Our method uses a multi-lingual model in which several DNN layers are shared between languages. This architecture enables domain adaptation transforms learned for one well-resourced language to be applied to an entirely different low-resource language. First, to develop the technique we use English as a well-resourced language and take Spanish to mimic a low-resource language. Experiments in domain adaptation between the conversational telephone speech (CTS) domain and broadcast news (BN) domain demonstrate a 29% relative WER improvement on Spanish BN test data by using only English adaptation data. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for low-resource languages with a poor match to the well-resourced language. Even in this scenario, the proposed method achieves relative WER improvements of 18-27% by using solely English data for domain adaptation.

Multi-channel Time-Varying Covariance Matrix Model for Late Reverberation Reduction,Masahito Togami,1,"In this paper, a multi-channel time-varying covariance matrix model for late reverberation reduction is proposed. Reflecting that variance of the late reverberation is time-varying and it depends on past speech source variance, the proposed model is defined as convolution of a speech source variance with a multi-channel time-invariant covariance matrix of late reverberation. The multi-channel time-invariant covariance matrix can be interpreted as a covariance matrix of a multi-channel acoustic transfer function (ATF). An advantageous point of the covariance matrix model against a deterministic ATF model is that the covariance matrix model is robust against fluctuation of the ATF. We propose two covariance matrix models. The first model is a covariance matrix model of late reverberation in the original microphone input signal. The second one is a covariance matrix model of late reverberation in an extended microphone input signal which includes not only current microphone input signal but also past microphone input signal. The second one considers correlation between the current microphone input signal and the past microphone input signal. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively reduces reverberation especially in a time-varying ATF scenario and the second model is shown to be more effective than the first model.",1356,2019,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,6.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08710v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08710v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08710v1,1910.08710v1
Frequency-Sliding Generalized Cross-Correlation: A Sub-band Time Delay Estimation Approach,"Maximo Cobos, Fabio Antonacci, Luca Comanducci, Augusto Sarti",4,"The generalized cross correlation (GCC) is regarded as the most popular approach for estimating the time difference of arrival (TDOA) between the signals received at two sensors. Time delay estimates are obtained by maximizing the GCC output, where the direct-path delay is usually observed as a prominent peak. Moreover, GCCs play also an important role in steered response power (SRP) localization algorithms, where the SRP functional can be written as an accumulation of the GCCs computed from multiple sensor pairs. Unfortunately, the accuracy of TDOA estimates is affected by multiple factors, including noise, reverberation and signal bandwidth. In this paper, a sub-band approach for time delay estimation aimed at improving the performance of the conventional GCC is presented. The proposed method is based on the extraction of multiple GCCs corresponding to different frequency bands of the cross-power spectrum phase in a sliding-window fashion. The major contributions of this paper include: 1) a sub-band GCC representation of the cross-power spectrum phase that, despite having a reduced temporal resolution, provides a more suitable representation for estimating the true TDOA; 2) such matrix representation is shown to be rank one in the ideal noiseless case, a property that is exploited in more adverse scenarios to obtain a more robust and accurate GCC; 3) we propose a set of low-rank approximation alternatives for processing the sub-band GCC matrix, leading to better TDOA estimates and source localization performance.

Following this trend, we propose a simple approach that performs a mapping from the speech waveform to a target signal from which the GCIs are obtained by peak-picking. However, the ground truth GCIs used for training and evaluation are usually extracted from EGG signals, which are not perfectly reliable and often not available. To overcome this problem, we propose to train our network on high-quality synthetic speech with perfect ground truth.

The same DIHARD dataset, drawn from 11 different domains is used for evaluation under two scenarios. In the in-domain scenario where the training and test sets cover the exact same domains, we show that the domain-adversarial approach does not degrade performance of the proposed end-to-end model. In the out-domain scenario where the test domain is different from training domains, it brings a relative improvement of more than 10%.

Learning deep representations by multilayer bootstrap networks for speaker diarization,"Meng-Zhen Li, Xiao-Lei Zhang",2,"The performance of speaker diarization is strongly affected by its clustering algorithm at the test stage. However, it is known that clustering algorithms are sensitive to random noises and small variations, particularly when the clustering algorithms themselves suffer some weaknesses, such as bad local minima and prior assumptions. To deal with the problem, a compact representation of speech segments with small within-class variances and large between-class distances is usually needed. In this paper, we apply an unsupervised deep model, named multilayer bootstrap network (MBN), to further process the embedding vectors of speech segments for the above problem. MBN is an unsupervised deep model for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Unlike traditional neural network based deep model, it is a stack of $k$-centroids clustering ensembles, each of which is trained simply by random resampling of data and one-nearest-neighbor optimization. We construct speaker diarization systems by combining MBN with either the i-vector frontend or x-vector frontend, and evaluated their effectiveness on a simulated NIST diarization dataset, the AMI meeting corpus, and NIST SRE 2000 CALLHOME database. Experimental results show that the proposed systems are better than or at least comparable to the systems that do not use MBN.",1324,2019,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,6.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10969v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10969v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10969v1,1910.10969v1
Analyzing the impact of speaker localization errors on speech separation for automatic speech recognition,"Sunit Sivasankaran, Emmaneul Vincent, Dominique Fohr",3,"We investigate the effect of speaker localization on the performance of speech recognition systems in a multispeaker, multichannel environment. Given the speaker location information, speech separation is performed in three stages. In the first stage, a simple delay-and-sum (DS) beamformer is used to enhance the signal impinging from the speaker location which is then used to estimate a time-frequency mask corresponding to the localized speaker using a neural network. This mask is used to compute the second order statistics and to derive an adaptive beamformer in the third stage. We generated a multichannel, multispeaker, reverberated, noisy dataset inspired from the well studied WSJ0-2mix and study the performance of the proposed pipeline in terms of the word error rate (WER). An average WER of $29.4$% was achieved using the ground truth localization information and $42.4$% using the localization information estimated via GCC-PHAT. The signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) between the speakers has a higher impact on the ASR performance, to the extent of reducing the WER by $59$% relative for a SIR increase of $15$ dB. By contrast, increasing the spatial distance to $50^\circ$ or more improves the WER by $23$% relative only",1240,2019,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,6.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11114v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11114v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11114v1,1910.11114v1

In this work we propose to separate the sources using a Speaker LOcalization Guided Deflation (SLOGD) approach wherein we estimate the sources iteratively. In each iteration we first estimate the location of the speaker and use it to estimate a mask corresponding to the localized speaker. The estimated source is removed from the mixture before estimating the location and mask of the next source.

The proposed framework achieves 28% word error rate reduction (WERR) over a separately optimized system on AISHELL-1 and shows consistent robustness to signal to interference ratio (SIR) and angle difference between overlapping speakers. Next, a further exploration shows that the speech recognition is improved with a simplified structure by replacing the FBANK extraction layer in the joint model with a learnable feature projection.

Modeling of Rakugo Speech and Its Limitations: Toward Speech Synthesis That Entertains Audiences,"Shuhei Kato, Yusuke Yasuda, Xin Wang, Erica Cooper, Shinji Takaki, Junichi Yamagishi",6,"We have been investigating rakugo speech synthesis as a challenging example of speech synthesis that entertains audiences. Rakugo is a traditional Japanese form of verbal entertainment similar to a combination of one-person stand-up comedy and comic storytelling and is popular even today. In rakugo, a performer plays multiple characters, and conversations or dialogues between the characters make the story progress. To investigate how close the quality of synthesized rakugo speech can approach that of professionals' speech, we modeled rakugo speech using Tacotron 2, a state-of-the-art speech synthesis system that can produce speech that sounds as natural as human speech albeit under limited conditions, and an enhanced version of it with self-attention to better consider long-term dependencies. We also used global style tokens and manually labeled context features to enrich speaking styles. Through a listening test, we measured not only naturalness but also distinguishability of characters, understandability of the content, and the degree of entertainment. Although we found that the speech synthesis models could not yet reach the professional level, the results of the listening test provided interesting insights: 1) we should not focus only on the naturalness of synthesized speech but also the distinguishability of characters and the understandability of the content to further entertain audiences; 2) the fundamental frequency (fo) expressions of synthesized speech are poorer than those of human speech, and more entertaining speech should have richer fo expression. Although there is room for improvement, we believe this is an important stepping stone toward achieving entertaining speech synthesis at the professional level.",1749,2019,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,6.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00137v3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.00137v3.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00137v3,1911.00137v3
Deep neural networks for emotion recognition combining audio and transcripts,"Jaejin Cho, Raghavendra Pappagari, Purva Kulkarni, Jesus Villalba, Yishay Carmiel, Najim Dehak",6,"In this paper, we propose to improve emotion recognition by combining acoustic information and conversation transcripts. On the one hand, an LSTM network was used to detect emotion from acoustic features like f0, shimmer, jitter, MFCC, etc. On the other hand, a multi-resolution CNN was used to detect emotion from word sequences. This CNN consists of several parallel convolutions with different kernel sizes to exploit contextual information at different levels. A temporal pooling layer aggregates the hidden representations of different words into a unique sequence level embedding, from which we computed the emotion posteriors. We optimized a weighted sum of classification and verification losses. The verification loss tries to bring embeddings from the same emotions closer while separating embeddings from different emotions. We also compared our CNN with state-of-the-art text-based hand-crafted features (e-vector). We evaluated our approach on the USC-IEMOCAP dataset as well as the dataset consisting of US English telephone speech.

Mask-dependent Phase Estimation for Monaural Speaker Separation,"Zhaoheng Ni, Michael I Mandel",2,"Speaker separation refers to isolating speech of interest in a multi-talker environment. Most methods apply real-valued Time-Frequency (T-F) masks to the mixture Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to reconstruct the clean speech. Hence there is an unavoidable mismatch between the phase of the reconstruction and the original phase of the clean speech. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective phase estimation network that predicts the phase of the clean speech based on a T-F mask predicted by a chimera++ network. To overcome the label-permutation problem for both the T-F mask and the phase, we propose a mask-dependent permutation invariant training (PIT) criterion to select the phase signal based on the loss from the T-F mask prediction. We also propose an Inverse Mask Weighted Loss Function for phase prediction to focus the model on the T-F regions in which the phase is more difficult to predict. Results on the WSJ0-2mix dataset show that the phase estimation network achieves comparable performance to models that use iterative phase reconstruction or end-to-end time-domain loss functions, but in a more straightforward manner.",1151,2019,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,6.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02746v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02746v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02746v2,1911.02746v2
Signal-Adaptive and Perceptually Optimized Sound Zones with Variable Span Trade-Off Filters,"Taewoong Lee, Jesper Kjær Nielsen, Mads Græsbøll Christensen",3,"Creating sound zones has been an active research field since the idea was first proposed. So far, most sound zone control methods rely on either an optimization of physical metrics such as acoustic contrast and signal distortion or a mode decomposition of the desired sound field. By using these types of methods, approximately 15 dB of acoustic contrast between the reproduced sound field in the target zone and its leakage to other zone(s) has been reported in practical set-ups, but this is typically not high enough to satisfy the people inside the zones. In this paper, we propose a sound zone control method shaping the leakage errors so that they are as inaudible as possible for a given acoustic contrast. The shaping of the leakage errors is performed by taking the time-varying input signal characteristics and the human auditory system into account when the loudspeaker control filters are calculated. We show how this shaping can be performed using variable span trade-off filters, and we show theoretically how these filters can be used for trading signal distortion in the target zone for acoustic contrast. The proposed method is evaluated based on physical metrics such as acoustic contrast and perceptual metrics such as STOI. The computational complexity and processing time of the proposed method for different system set-ups are also investigated. Lastly, the results of a MUSHRA listening test are reported. The test results show that the proposed method provides more than 20% perceptual improvement compared to existing sound zone control methods.",1570,2019,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,6.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10016v3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10016v3.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10016v3,1911.10016v3

The system consists of three separately trained components: an x-vector speaker encoder, a Tacotron-based synthesizer and a WaveNet vocoder. It is conditioned on 3 kinds of embeddings: (1) speaker embedding so that the system can be trained with speech from many speakers will little data from each speaker; (2) language embedding with shared phoneme inputs; (3) stress and tone embedding which improves naturalness of synthesized speech, especially for a tonal language like Mandarin. By adjusting the various embeddings, MOS results show that our method can generate high-quality natural and intelligible native speech for native/foreign seen/unseen speakers. Intelligibility and naturalness of accented speech is low as expected. Speaker similarity is good for native speech from native speakers. Interestingly, speaker similarity is also good for accented speech from foreign speakers.

We test their effectiveness in real-world noisy conditions by extracting these cues through an automatic diarization and speech recognition front-end. Evaluation is performed by classifying 3 degrees of suicidal risk: none, ideation, attempt.

The TSN outperformed various state-of-the-art methods; however, it adopted the simple deep neural network as pri-NN. We have found that the pri-NN affects the performance (in perceptual quality), more than post-NN; therefore we adopted the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) as pri-NN to boost the context information usage within speech signals. Further, the TSN framework did not consider the phase reconstruction, though phase information affected the perceptual quality. Therefore, we proposed to adopt the phase reconstruction method based on the Griffin-Lim algorithm.

The recently proposed LPCNet vocoder has successfully achieved high-quality and lightweight speech synthesis systems by combining a vocal tract LP filter with a WaveRNN-based vocal source (i.e., excitation) generator. However, the quality of synthesized speech is often unstable because the vocal source component is insufficiently represented by the mu-law quantization method, and the model is trained without considering the entire speech production mechanism. To address this problem, we first introduce LP-MDN, which enables the autoregressive neural vocoder to structurally represent the interactions between the vocal tract and vocal source components.

Multitask Learning with Capsule Networks for Speech-to-Intent Applications,"Jakob Poncelet, Hugo Van hamme",2,"Voice controlled applications can be a great aid to society, especially for physically challenged people. However this requires robustness to all kinds of variations in speech. A spoken language understanding system that learns from interaction with and demonstrations from the user, allows the use of such a system in different settings and for different types of speech, even for deviant or impaired speech, while also allowing the user to choose a phrasing. The user gives a command and enters its intent through an interface, after which the model learns to map the speech directly to the right action. Since the effort of the user should be as low as possible, capsule networks have drawn interest due to potentially needing little training data compared to deeper neural networks. In this paper, we show how capsules can incorporate multitask learning, which often can improve the performance of a model when the task is difficult. The basic capsule network will be expanded with a regularisation to create more structure in its output: it learns to identify the speaker of the utterance by forcing the required information into the capsule vectors. To this end we move from a speaker dependent to a speaker independent setting.",1234,2020,"2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal

Since there are only annotations for audio tagging available in weakly-supervised SED, we design multiple branches with different learning purposes instead of pursuing multiple tasks. Similar to multiple tasks, multiple different learning purposes can also prevent the common feature which the multiple branches share from overfitting to any one of the learning purposes. We design these multiple different learning purposes based on combinations of different MIL strategies and different pooling methods.

Lightweight Online Separation of the Sound Source of Interest through BLSTM-Based Binary Masking,"Alejandro Maldonado, Caleb Rascon, Ivette Velez",3,"Online audio source separation has been an important part of auditory scene analysis and robot audition. The main type of technique to carry this out, because of its online capabilities, has been spatial filtering (or beamforming), where it is assumed that the location (mainly, the direction of arrival; DOA) of the source of interest (SOI) is known. However, these techniques suffer from considerable interference leakage in the final result. In this paper, we propose a two step technique: 1) a phase-based beamformer that provides, in addition to the estimation of the SOI, an estimation of the cumulative environmental interference; and 2) a BLSTM-based TF binary masking stage that calculates a binary mask that aims to separate the SOI from the cumulative environmental interference. In our tests, this technique provides a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) above 20 dB with simulated data. Because of the nature of the beamformer outputs, the label permutation problem is handled from the beginning.

Results showed that vowels 'a', 'i', 'o' have the most significant contribution in the conversion success. The voiceless sounds were also found to be most affected by the noisy training data.

Non-linear mapping ability of neural network was employed in mapping the source speech vectors into the acoustic vector space of the target. Training LPC coefficients with neural network yielded a poor result due to the instability of the LPC filter poles.

When humans identify an acoustic scene, the existence of different sound events provides discriminative information which affects the judgement. The proposed framework mimics this mechanism using various approaches. Firstly, we employ three methods to concatenate tag vectors extracted using an audio tagging system with an intermediate hidden layer of an acoustic scene classification system. We also explore the multi-head attention on the feature map of an acoustic scene classification system using tag vectors.

Deep Generative Variational Autoencoding for Replay Spoof Detection in Automatic Speaker Verification,"Bhusan Chettri, Tomi Kinnunen, Emmanouil Benetos",3,"Automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are highly vulnerable to presentation attacks, also called spoofing attacks. Replay is among the simplest attacks to mount - yet difficult to detect reliably. The generalization failure of spoofing countermeasures (CMs) has driven the community to study various alternative deep learning CMs. The majority of them are supervised approaches that learn a human-spoof discriminator. In this paper, we advocate a different, deep generative approach that leverages from powerful unsupervised manifold learning in classification. The potential benefits include the possibility to sample new data, and to obtain insights to the latent features of genuine and spoofed speech. To this end, we propose to use variational autoencoders (VAEs) as an alternative backend for replay attack detection, via three alternative models that differ in their class-conditioning. The first one, similar to the use of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in spoof detection, is to train independently two VAEs - one for each class. The second one is to train a single conditional model (C-VAE) by injecting a one-hot class label vector to the encoder and decoder networks. Our final proposal integrates an auxiliary classifier to guide the learning of the latent space. Our experimental results using constant-Q cepstral coefficient (CQCC) features on the ASVspoof 2017 and 2019 physical access subtask datasets indicate that the C-VAE offers substantial improvement in comparison to training two separate VAEs for each class. On the 2019 dataset, the C-VAE outperforms the VAE and the baseline GMM by an absolute 9 - 10% in both equal error rate (EER) and tandem detection cost function (t-DCF) metrics.

Dialects are language varieties that enclose characteristics specific for a given region or community. These characteristics reflect segmental and suprasegmental (prosodic) differences but also high-level properties such as lexical and morphosyntactic. One aspect that is of particular interest and that has not been studied extensively is how the differences in prosody may underpin the potential differences among different dialects. To address this, this work focuses on investigating the standard acoustic prosodic features of energy, fundamental frequency, spectral tilt, duration, and their combinations, using sequential and context-independent supervised classification methods, and evaluated separately over two different units in speech: words and syllables. The primary aim of this work is to gain a better understanding on the role of prosody in identifying among the different language varieties.

In particular, the classification is performed on a set of sound spectral intensities, whose frequencies are selected by minimizing the Bayes risk. This optimization allows the algorithm to capture sound frequencies that are essential for each discrimination task, resulting in a good assessment performance.

Improved Source Counting and Separation for Monaural Mixture,"Yiming Xiao, Haijian Zhang",2,"Single-channel speech separation in time domain and frequency domain has been widely studied for voice-driven applications over the past few years. Most of previous works assume known number of speakers in advance, however, which is not easily accessible through monaural mixture in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel model of single-channel multi-speaker separation by jointly learning the time-frequency feature and the unknown number of speakers. Specifically, our model integrates the time-domain convolution encoded feature map and the frequency-domain spectrogram by attention mechanism, and the integrated features are projected into high-dimensional embedding vectors which are then clustered with deep attractor network to modify the encoded feature. Meanwhile, the number of speakers is counted by computing the Gerschgorin disks of the embedding vectors which are orthogonal for different speakers. Finally, the modified encoded feature is inverted to the sound waveform using a linear decoder. Experimental evaluation on the GRID dataset shows that the proposed method with a single model can accurately estimate the number of speakers with 96.7 % probability of success, while achieving the state-of-the-art separation results on multi-speaker mixtures in terms of scale-invariant signal-to-noise ratio improvement (SI-SNRi) and signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (SDRi).",1397,2020,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,5.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00175v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00175v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00175v1,2004.00175v1

In this paper, we propose a more flexible source signal called cyclic noise, a quasi-periodic noise sequence given by the convolution of a pulse train and a static random noise with a trainable decaying rate that controls the signal shape. We further propose a masked spectral loss to guide the NSF models to produce periodic voiced sounds from the cyclic noise-based source signal. Results from a large-scale listening test demonstrated the effectiveness of the cyclic noise and the masked spectral loss on speaker-independent NSF models in copy-synthesis experiments on the CMU ARCTIC database.",958,2020,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,5.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02191v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02191v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02191v2,2004.02191v2

Emotional Voice Conversion With Cycle-consistent Adversarial Network,"Songxiang Liu, Yuewen Cao, Helen Meng",3,"Emotional Voice Conversion, or emotional VC, is a technique of converting speech from one emotion state into another one, keeping the basic linguistic information and speaker identity. Previous approaches for emotional VC need parallel data and use dynamic time warping (DTW) method to temporally align the source-target speech parameters. These approaches often define a minimum generation loss as the objective function, such as L1 or L2 loss, to learn model parameters. Recently, cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) have been used successfully for non-parallel VC. This paper investigates the efficacy of using CycleGAN for emotional VC tasks. Rather than attempting to learn a mapping between parallel training data using a frame-to-frame minimum generation loss, the CycleGAN uses two discriminators and one classifier to guide the learning process, where the discriminators aim to differentiate between the natural and converted speech and the classifier aims to classify the underlying emotion from the natural and converted speech. The training process of the CycleGAN models randomly pairs source-target speech parameters, without any temporal alignment operation. The objective and subjective evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of using CycleGAN models for emotional VC. The non-parallel training for a CycleGAN indicates its potential for non-parallel emotional VC.",1410,2020,,arXiv Audio and Speech Processing,0,0,0,0,5.5,Audio and Speech Processing,eess.AS,https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03781v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03781v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03781v1,2004.03781v1

Phonetic posteriorgrams (PPGs) containing rich linguistic information are incorporated into the conversion model as auxiliary input features, which boost the conversion performance. To leverage the advantages of the newly emerged neural vocoders, we investigate the conditional WaveNet and flow-based WaveNet (FloWaveNet) as speech generators.

Noise Tokens: Learning Neural Noise Templates for Environment-Aware Speech Enhancement,"Haoyu Li, Junichi Yamagishi",2,"In recent years, speech enhancement (SE) has achieved impressive progress with the success of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the DNN approach usually fails to generalize well to unseen environmental noise that is not included in the training. To address this problem, we propose ""noise tokens"" (NTs), which are a set of neural noise templates that are jointly trained with the SE system. NTs dynamically capture the environment variability and thus enable the DNN model to handle various environments to produce STFT magnitude with higher quality. Experimental results show that using NTs is an effective strategy that consistently improves the generalization ability of SE systems across different DNN architectures. Furthermore, we investigate applying a state-of-the-art neural vocoder to generate waveform instead of traditional inverse STFT (ISTFT).

We investigate the use of phone-based subwords, in particular, byte pair encoder (BPE), as modeling units for end-to-end speech recognition. In addition, we also developed multi-level language model-based decoding algorithms based on a pronunciation dictionary. Besides the use of the lexicon, which is easily available, our system avoids the need of additional expert knowledge or processing steps from conventional systems.

According to these series representations, the impact of several waveform parameters on the estimation accuracy is investigated, which reveals that the CRLB of the Doppler stretch is inversely proportional to the effective time-bandwidth product of the waveform. This conclusion generalizes a previous result in the narrowband case.

The proposed technique is based on creating an opposite-phase baseband equivalent replica of the TX leakage signal in the transceiver digital front-end through adaptive nonlinear filtering of the known transmit data, to facilitate highly accurate cancellation under a nonlinear TX power amplifier (PA). The active RF cancellation is then accomplished by employing an auxiliary transmitter chain, to generate the actual RF cancellation signal, and combining it with the received signal at the receiver (RX) low noise amplifier (LNA) input. A closed-loop parameter learning approach, based on the decorrelation principle, is also developed to efficiently estimate the coefficients of the nonlinear cancellation filter in the presence of a nonlinear TX PA with memory, finite passive isolation, and a nonlinear RX LNA. The performance of the proposed cancellation technique is evaluated through comprehensive RF measurements adopting commercial LTE-Advanced transceiver hardware components. The results show that the proposed technique can provide an additional suppression of up to 54 dB for the TX passband leakage signal at the RX LNA input, even at considerably high transmit power levels and with wide transmission bandwidths.

Spectral and Energy Efficiency of Superimposed Pilots in Uplink Massive MIMO,"Daniel Verenzuela, Emil Björnson, Luca Sanguinetti",3,"Next generation wireless networks aim at providing substantial improvements in spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). Massive MIMO has been proved to be a viable technology to achieve these goals by spatially multiplexing several users using many base station (BS) antennas. A potential limitation of Massive MIMO in multicell systems is pilot contamination, which arises in the channel estimation process from the interference caused by reusing pilots in neighboring cells. A standard method to reduce pilot contamination, known as regular pilot (RP), is to adjust the length of pilot sequences while transmitting data and pilot symbols disjointly. An alternative method, called superimposed pilot (SP), sends a superposition of pilot and data symbols. This allows to use longer pilots which, in turn, reduces pilot contamination. We consider the uplink of a multicell Massive MIMO network using maximum ratio combining detection and compare RP and SP in terms of SE and EE. To this end, we derive rigorous closed-form achievable rates with SP under a practical random BS deployment.

Existing designs exploit the spatiotemporal correlations among data collected by a specific sensing modality. However, many applications, such as environmental monitoring, involve collecting heterogeneous data that are intrinsically correlated.

Reliability assessment of microgrid with renewable generation and prioritized loads,"O. A. Ansari, N. Safar, C. Y. Chung",3,"With the increase in awareness about the climate change, there has been a tremendous shift towards utilizing renewable energy sources (RES). In this regard, smart grid technologies have been presented to facilitate higher penetration of RES. Microgrids are the key components of the smart grids. Microgrids allow integration of various distributed energy resources (DER) such as the distributed generation (DGs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) into the distribution system and hence remove or delay the need for distribution expansion. One of the crucial requirements for utilities is to ensure that the system reliability is maintained with the inclusion of microgrid topology. Therefore, this paper evaluates the reliability of a microgrid containing prioritized loads and distributed RES through a hybrid analytical-simulation method. The stochasticity of RES introduces complexity to the reliability evaluation. The method takes into account the variability of RES through Monte- Carlo state sampling simulation. The results indicate the reliability enhancement of the overall system in the presence of the microgrid topology. In particular, the highest priority load has the largest improvement in the reliability indices. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is performed to understand the effects of the failure of microgrid islanding in the case of a fault in the upstream network.",1388,2017,,arXiv Signal Processing,0,0,0,0,8.5,Signal Processing,eess.SP,https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07970v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07970v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07970v1,1709.07970v1

Magnetless Circulators Based on Spatiotemporal Modulation of Bandstop Filters in a Delta Topology,"Ahmed Kord, Dimitrios L. Sounas, Andrea Alù",3,"In this paper, we discuss the design rationale and guidelines to build magnet-less circulators based on spatio-temporal modulation of resonant junctions consisting of first-order bandstop filters connected in a delta topology. Without modulation, the junction does not allow transmission between its ports, however, when the natural oscillation frequencies of the constituent LC filters are modulated in time with a suitable phase pattern, a synthetic angular-momentum bias can be effectively imparted to the junction and a transmission window opens at one of the output ports, thus realizing a circulator. We develop a rigorous small-signal linear model and find analytical expressions for the harmonic S-parameters of the proposed circuit, which significantly facilitate the design process. We validate the theory with simulations and further discuss the large signal response, including power handling and non-linearity, and the noise performance.

The resonant poles of each SE circulator are modulated in time with 120 deg phase-shifted periodic signals, resulting in synthetic angular-momentum biasing achieved through spatiotemporal modulation (STM). We tailor the two SE circulators to exhibit a constant 180 deg phase difference between their STM biases. Unlike conventional differential time-variant circuits, for which only the even or odd spurs are rejected, we show that the proposed configuration cancels out all intermodulation (IM) products, thus making them operate alike linear time-invariant (LTI) circuits for an external observer. In turn, this property enhances all metrics of the resulting circulator, overcoming the limitations of SE architectures, and improving insertion loss, impedance matching, bandwidth and noise figure. We show that this differential architecture also significantly relaxes the required modulation parameters, both in frequency and amplitude. We develop a rigorous small-signal model to guide the design of the proposed circuits and to get insights into their pseudo-LTI characteristics.

Performance Bounds for Parameter Estimation under Misspecified Models: Fundamental findings and applications,"S. Fortunati, F. Gini, M. S. Greco, C. D. Richmond",4,"Inferring information from a set of acquired data is the main objective of any signal processing (SP) method. In particular, the common problem of estimating the value of a vector of parameters from a set of noisy measurements is at the core of a plethora of scientific and technological advances in the last decades; for example, wireless communications, radar and sonar, biomedicine, image processing, and seismology, just to name a few. Developing an estimation algorithm often begins by assuming a statistical model for the measured data, i.e. a probability density function (pdf) which if correct, fully characterizes the behaviour of the collected data/measurements. Experience with real data, however, often exposes the limitations of any assumed data model since modelling errors at some level are always present. Consequently, the true data model and the model assumed to derive the estimation algorithm could differ. When this happens, the model is said to be mismatched or misspecified. Therefore, understanding the possible performance loss or regret that an estimation algorithm could experience under model misspecification is of crucial importance for any SP practitioner. Further, understanding the limits on the performance of any estimator subject to model misspecification is of practical interest. Motivated by the widespread and practical need to assess the performance of a mismatched estimator, the goal of this paper is to help to bring attention to the main theoretical findings on estimation theory, and in particular on lower bounds under model misspecification, that have been published in the statistical and econometrical literature in the last fifty years.

Compressed Air Energy Storage-Part I: An Accurate Bi-linear Cavern Model,"Junpeng Zhan, Osama Aslam Ansari, C. Y. Chung",3,"Compressed air energy storage (CAES) is suitable for large-scale energy storage and can help to increase the penetration of wind power in power systems. A CAES plant consists of compressors, expanders, caverns, and a motor/generator set. Currently used cavern models for CAES are either accurate but highly non-linear or linear but inaccurate. Highly non-linear cavern models cannot be directly utilized in power system optimization problems. In this regard, an accurate bi-linear cavern model for CAES is proposed in this first paper of a two-part series. The charging and discharging processes in a cavern are divided into several virtual states and then the first law of thermodynamics and ideal gas law are used to derive a cavern model, i.e., model for the variation of temperature and pressure in these processes. Thereafter, the heat transfer between the air in the cavern and the cavern wall is considered and integrated into the cavern model. By subsequently eliminating several negligible terms, the cavern model reduces to a bi-linear (linear) model for CAES with multiple (single) time steps. The accuracy of the proposed cavern model is verified via comparison with an accurate non-linear model.",1208,2017,,arXiv Signal Processing,0,0,0,0,8.5,Signal Processing,eess.SP,https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08272v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08272v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08272v2,1709.08272v2

Existing cavern models for the CAES used in power system optimization problems are not accurate, which may lead to infeasible solutions, e.g., the air pressure in the cavern is outside its operating range. In this regard, an accurate CAES model is proposed for the UC problem based on the accurate bi-linear cavern model proposed in the first paper of this two-part series. The minimum switch time between the charging and discharging processes of CAES is considered. The whole model, i.e., the UC model with an accurate CAES model, is a large-scale mixed integer bi-linear programming problem. To reduce the complexity of the whole model, three strategies are proposed to reduce the number of bi-linear terms without sacrificing accuracy. McCormick relaxation and piecewise linearization are then used to linearize the whole model. To decrease the solution time, a method to obtain an initial solution of the linearized model is proposed.

Biosignal Analysis with Matching-Pursuit Based Adaptive Chirplet Transform,"Jie Cui, Dinghui Wang",2,"Chirping phenomena, in which the instantaneous frequencies of a signal change with time, are abundant in signals related to biological systems. Biosignals are non-stationary in nature and the time-frequency analysis is a viable tool to analyze them. It is well understood that Gaussian chirplet function is critical in describing chirp signals. Despite the theory of adaptive chirplet transform (ACT) has been established for more than two decades and is well accepted in the community of signal processing, application of ACT to bio-/biomedical signal analysis is still quite limited, probably because that the power of ACT, as an emerging tool for biosignal analysis, has not yet been fully appreciated by the researchers in the field of biomedical engineering. In this paper, we describe a novel ACT algorithm based on the ""coarse-refinement"" scheme. Namely, the initial estimate of a chirplet is implemented with the matching-pursuit (MP) algorithm and subsequently it is refined using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which we coin as MPEM algorithm. We emphasize the robustness enhancement of the algorithm in face of noise, which is important to biosignal analysis, as they are usually embedded in strong background noise. We then demonstrate the capability of our algorithm by applying it to the analysis of representative biosignals, including visual evoked potentials (bioelectrical signals), audible heart sounds and bat ultrasonic echolocation signals (bioacoustic signals), and human speech. The results show that the MPEM algorithm provides more compact representation of signals under investigation and clearer visualization of their time-frequency structures, indicating considerable promise of ACT in biosignal analysis.

Our results reveal that the BER performance of uplink massive MIMO systems with a few-bit resolution ADCs is comparable to the case of having full precision ADCs.

Phased Array-Based Sub-Nyquist Sampling for Joint Wideband Spectrum Sensing and Direction-of-Arrival Estimation,"Feiyu Wang, Jun Fang, Huiping Duan, Hongbin Li",4,"In this paper, we study the problem of joint wideband spectrum sensing and direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation in a sub-Nyquist sampling framework. Specifically, considering a scenario where a few uncorrelated narrowband signals spread over a wide (say, several GHz) frequency band, our objective is to estimate the carrier frequencies and the DoAs associated with the narrowband sources, as well as reconstruct the power spectra of these narrowband signals. To overcome the sampling rate bottleneck for wideband spectrum sensing, we propose a new phased-array based sub-Nyquist sampling architecture with variable time delays, where a uniform linear array (ULA) is employed and the received signal at each antenna is delayed by a variable amount of time and then sampled by a synchronized low-rate analog-digital converter (ADC). Based on the collected sub-Nyquist samples, we calculate a set of cross-correlation matrices with different time lags, and develop a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition-based method for joint DoA, carrier frequency and power spectrum recovery. Perfect recovery conditions for the associated parameters and the power spectrum are analyzed. Our analysis reveals that our proposed method does not require to place any sparse constraint on the wideband spectrum, only needs the sampling rate to be greater than the bandwidth of the narrowband source signal with the largest bandwidth among all sources.

This is realized by developing a general framework for the symbol error rate (SER) analysis of coherent phase shift keying, noncoherent differential phase shift keying and noncoherent frequency shift keying under IQI effects. In this context, the moment generating function of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio is first derived for both single-carrier and multi-carrier systems suffering from transmitter (TX) IQI only, receiver (RX) IQI only and joint TX/RX IQI.

These expressions are corroborated by comparisons with corresponding results from computer simulations and they provide insights into the dependence of IQI on the system parameters.

The Impact of Transceiver Noise on Digital Nonlinearity Compensation,"Daniel Semrau, Domanic Lavery, Lidia Galdino, Robert I. Killey, Polina Bayvel",5,"The efficiency of digital nonlinearity compensation (NLC) is analyzed in the presence of noise arising from amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE) as well as from a non-ideal transceiver subsystem. Its impact on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reach increase is studied with particular emphasis on split NLC, where the digital back-propagation algorithm is divided between transmitter and receiver. An analytical model is presented to compute the SNR's for non-ideal transmission systems with arbitrary split NLC configurations. When signal-signal nonlinearities are compensated, the performance limitation arises from residual signal-noise interactions. These interactions consist of nonlinear beating between the signal and co-propagating ASE and transceiver noise. While transceiver noise-signal beating is usually dominant for short transmission distances, ASE noise-signal beating is dominant for larger transmission distances. It is shown that both regimes behave differently with respect to the optimal NLC split ratio and their respective reach gains. Additionally, simple formulas for the prediction of the optimal NLC split ratio and the reach increase in those two regimes are reported. It is found that split NLC offers negligible gain with respect to conventional digital back-propagation (DBP) for distances less than 1000 km using standard single-mode fibers and a transceiver (back-to-back) SNR of 26 dB, when transmitter and receiver inject the same amount of noise. However, when transmitter and receiver inject an unequal amount of noise, reach gains of 56% on top of DBP are achievable by properly tailoring the split NLC algorithm.

Photonic machine learning implementation for signal recovery in optical communications,"Apostolos Argyris, Julián Bueno, Ingo Fischer",3,"Machine learning techniques have proven very efficient in assorted classification tasks. Nevertheless, processing time-dependent high-speed signals can turn into an extremely challenging task, especially when these signals have been nonlinearly distorted. Recently, analogue hardware concepts using nonlinear transient responses have been gaining significant interest for fast information processing. Here, we introduce a simplified photonic reservoir computing scheme for data classification of severely distorted optical communication signals after extended fibre transmission. To this end, we convert the direct bit detection process into a pattern recognition problem. Using an experimental implementation of our photonic reservoir computer, we demonstrate an improvement in bit-error-rate by two orders of magnitude, compared to directly classifying the transmitted signal. This improvement corresponds to an extension of the communication range by over 75%.

Lung sound classification using local binary pattern,"Nandini Sengupta, Md Sahidullah, Goutam Saha",3,"Lung sounds contain vital information about pulmonary pathology. In this paper, we use short-term spectral characteristics of lung sounds to recognize associated diseases. Motivated by the success of auditory perception based techniques in speech signal classification, we represent time-frequency information of lung sounds using mel-scale warped spectral coefficients, called here as mel-frequency spectral coefficients (MFSCs). Next, we employ local binary pattern analysis (LBP) to capture texture information of the MFSCs, and the feature vectors are subsequently derived using histogram representation. The proposed features are used with three well-known classifiers in this field: k-nearest neighbor (kNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). Also, the performance was tested with multiple SVM kernels. We conduct extensive performance evaluation experiments using two databases which include normal and adventitious sounds. Results show that the proposed features with SVM and also with kNN classifier outperform commonly used wavelet-based features as well as our previously investigated mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) based statistical features, specifically in abnormal sound detection. Proposed features also yield better results than morphological features and energy features computed from rational dilation wavelet coefficients. The Bhattacharyya kernel performs considerably better than other kernels. Further, we optimize the configuration of the proposed feature extraction algorithm. Finally, we have applied mRMR (minimum-redundancy maximum-relevancy) based feature selection method to remove redundancy in the feature vector which makes the proposed method computationally more efficient without any degradation in the performance.

A Spatial-Spectral Interference Model for Dense Finite-Area 5G mmWave Networks,"Solmaz Niknam, Balasubramaniam Natarajan, Reza Barazideh",3,"With the overcrowded sub-6 GHz bands, millimeter wave (mmWave) bands offer a promising alternative for the next generation wireless standard, i.e., 5G. However, the susceptibility of mmWave signals to severe pathloss and shadowing requires the use of highly directional antennas to overcome such adverse characteristics. Building a network with directional beams changes the interference behavior, since, narrow beams are vulnerable to blockages. Such sensitivity to blockages causes uncertainty in the active interfering node locations. Configuration uncertainty may also manifest in the spectral domain while applying dynamic channel and frequency assignment to support 5G applications. In this paper, we first propose a blockage model considering mmWave specifications. Subsequently, using the proposed blockage model, we derive a spatial-spectral interference model for dense finite-area 5G mmWave networks. The proposed interference model considers both spatial and spectral randomness in node configuration. Finally, the error performance of the network from an arbitrarily located user perspective is calculated in terms of bit error rate (BER) and outage probability metrics.

One factor that is influenced by such propagation characteristics is the interference behavior, which is also impacted by simultaneous use of the unlicensed portion of the spectrum by multiple users. Therefore, considering the propagation characteristics in the mmWave band, we propose a spatial-spectral interference model for 5G mmWave applications, in the presence of Poisson field of blockages and interferers operating in licensed and unlicensed mmWave spectrum.

Very large signal strength variations in first order scattered components is observed as the user moves over very short distances. This is due to the small-scale fading caused by rough surface scatterers. Furthermore, it is shown that the diffused scattering depends on the material roughness, the angle of incidence and the distance from the surface. Finally, results indicate that reflections from rough materials may suffer from high depolarization, a phenomenon that can potentially be exploited in order to improve the performance of mm-Wave systems using polarization diversity.",855,2017,,arXiv Signal Processing,0,0,0,0,8.5,Signal Processing,eess.SP,https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05631v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05631v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05631v1,1710.05631v1

We propose to employ non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for FSO backhauling where both BSs transmit at the same time and in the same frequency band to the same photodetector at the CU. We develop a dynamic NOMA scheme which determines the optimal decoding order as a function of the channel state information at the CU and the quality of service requirements of the BSs, such that the outage probabilities of both BSs are jointly minimized. Moreover, we analyze the performance of the proposed NOMA scheme in terms of the outage probability over Gamma-Gamma FSO turbulence channels. We further derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability for the high signal-to-noise ratio regime.

Distributed Coordinated Multicell Beamforming for Wireless Cellular Networks Powered by Renewables: A Stochastic ADMM Approach,"Shuyan Hu, Chongbin Xu, Xin Wang, Yongwei Huang, Shunqing Zhang",5,"The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) has facilitated efficient and sustainable resource allocation for wireless communication systems. In this paper, a novel framework is introduced to develop coordinated multicell beamforming (CMBF) design for wireless cellular networks powered by a smart microgrid, where the BSs are equipped with RES harvesting devices and can perform two-way (i.e., buying/selling) energy trading with the main grid. To this end, new models are put forth to account for the stochastic RES harvesting, two-way energy trading, and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) based energy transaction cost. Capitalizing on these models, we propose a distributed CMBF solution to minimize the grid-wide transaction cost subject to user quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Specifically, relying on state-of-the-art optimization tools, we show that the relevant task can be formulated as a convex problem that is well suited for development of a distributed solver. To cope with stochastic availability of the RES, the stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is then leveraged to develop a novel distributed CMBF scheme. It is established that the proposed scheme is guaranteed to yield the optimal CMBF solution, with only local channel state information available at each BS and limited information exchange among the BSs. Numerical results are provided to corroborate the merits of the proposed scheme.",1447,2017,,arXiv Signal Processing,0,0,0,0,8.5,Signal Processing,eess.SP,https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06043v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06043v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06043v1,1710.06043v1
Intentional Aliasing Method to Improve Sub-Nyquist Sampling System,"Jehyuk Jang, Sanghun Im, Heung-No Lee",3,"A modulated wideband converter (MWC) has been introduced as a sub-Nyquist sampler that exploits a set of fast alternating pseudo random (PR) signals. Through parallel sampling branches, an MWC compresses a multiband spectrum by mixing it with PR signals in the time domain, and acquires its sub-Nyquist samples. Previously, the ratio of compression was fully dependent on the specifications of PR signals. That is, to further reduce the sampling rate without information loss, faster and longer-period PR signals were needed. However, the implementation of such PR signal generators results in high power consumption and large fabrication area. In this paper, we propose a novel aliased modulated wideband converter (AMWC), which can further reduce the sampling rate of MWC with fixed PR signals. The main idea is to induce intentional signal aliasing at the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). In addition to the first spectral compression by the signal mixer, the intentional aliasing compresses the mixed spectrum once again. We demonstrate that AMWC reduces the number of sampling branches and the rate of ADC for lossless sub-Nyquist sampling without needing to upgrade the speed or period of PR signals. Conversely, for a given fixed number of sampling branches and sampling rate, AMWC improves the performance of signal reconstruction.",1341,2017,"Jehyuk Jang, Sanghun Im, and Heung-No Lee, ""Intentional aliasing

Estimation of Rain Attenuation at EHF bands for Earth-to-Satellite Links in Bangladesh,"S Md Sakir Hossain, Md Atiqul Islam",2,"Due to heavy congestion in lower frequency bands, engineers are looking for new frequency bands to support new services that require higher data rates, which in turn needs broader bandwidths. To meet this requirement, extremely high frequency (EHF), particularly Q (36 to 46 GHz) and V (46 to 56 GHz) bands, is the best viable solution because of its complete availability. The most serious challenge the EHF band poses is the attenuation caused by rain. This paper investigates the effect of the rain on Q and V bands' performances in Bangladeshi climatic conditions. The rain attenuations of the two bands are predicted for the four main regions of Bangladesh using ITU rain attenuation model. The measured rain statistics is used for this prediction. It is observed that the attenuation due to rain in the Q/V band reaches up to 150 dB which is much higher than that of the currently used Ka band.

A Study Of Optimal False Information Injection Attack On Dynamic State Estimation in Multi-Sensor Systems,"Jingyang Lu, Ruixin Niu",2,"In this paper, the impact of false information injection is investigated for linear dynamic systems with multiple sensors. It is assumed that the system is unsuspecting the existence of false information and the adversary is trying to maximize the negative effect of the false information on Kalman filter's estimation performance.

For the adversary, many closed-form results for the optimal attack strategies that maximize Kalman filter's estimation error are theoretically derived. It is shown that by choosing the optimal correlation coefficients among the bias noises and allocating power optimally among sensors, the adversary could significantly increase Kalman filter's estimation errors. To be concrete, a target tracking system is used as an example in the paper. From the adversary's point of view, the best attack strategies are obtained under different scenarios, including a single-sensor system with both position and velocity measurements, and a multi-sensor system with position and velocity measurements. Under a constraint on the total power of the injected bias noises, the optimal solutions are solved from two perspectives: trace and determinant. Numerical results are also provided in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack strategies.",1368,2017,,arXiv Signal Processing,0,0,0,0,8.5,Signal Processing,eess.SP,https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09962v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09962v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09962v1,1710.09962v1
An Automated Window Selection Procedure For DFT Based Detection Schemes To Reduce Windowing SNR Loss,Cagatay Candan,1,"The classical spectrum analysis methods utilize window functions to reduce the masking effect of a strong spectral component over weaker components. The main cost of side-lobe reduction is the reduction of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level of the output spectrum. We present a single snapshot method which optimizes the selection of most suitable window function among a finite set of candidate windows, say rectangle, Hamming, Blackman windows, for each spectral bin. The main goal is to utilize different window functions at each spectral output depending on the interference level encountered at that spectral bin so as to reduce the SNR loss associated with the windowing operation. Stated differently, the windows with strong interference suppression capabilities are utilized only when a sufficiently powerful interferer is corrupting the spectral bin of interest is present, i.e. only when this window is needed. The achieved reduction in the windowing SNR loss can be important for the detection of low SNR targets.",1023,2017,,arXiv Signal Processing,0,0,0,0,8.5,Signal Processing,eess.SP,https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10200v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10200v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10200v1,1710.10200v1

Shift-enabled graphs: Graphs where shift-invariant filters are representable as polynomials of shift operations,"Liyan Chen, Samuel Cheng, Vlandimir Stankovic, Lina Stankovic",4,"In digital signal processing, shift-invariant filters can be represented as a polynomial expansion of a shift operation,that is, the Z-transform representation. When extended to graph signal processing (GSP), this would mean that a shift-invariant graph filter can be represented as a polynomial of the adjacency (shift) matrix of the graph. However, the characteristic and minimum polynomials of the adjacency matrix must be identical for the property to hold. While it has been suggested that this condition might be ignored as it is always possible to find a polynomial transform to represent the original adjacency matrix by another adjacency matrix that satisfies the condition, this letter shows that a filter that is shift invariant in terms of the original graph may not be shift invariant anymore under the modified graph and vice versa. We introduce the notion of ""shift-enabled graph"" for graphs that satisfy the aforementioned condition, and present a concrete example of a graph that is not ""shift-enabled"" and a shift-invariant filter that is not a polynomial of the shift operation matrix. The result provides a deeper understanding of shift-invariant filters when applied in GSP and shows that further investigation of shift-enabled graphs is needed to make it applicable to practical scenarios.",1311,2017,,arXiv Signal Processing,0,0,0,0,8.5,Signal Processing,eess.SP,https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10450v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10450v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10450v2,1710.10450v2

It serves as a good candidate for the future communication network with massive nodes due to its capability of handling user overloading. Introducing SCMA to visible light communication (VLC) can provide another opportunity on design of transmission protocols for the communication network with massive nodes due to the limited communication range of VLC, which reduces the interference intensity. However, when applying SCMA in VLC systems, we need to modify the SCMA codebook to accommodate the real and positive signal requirement for VLC.We apply multidimensional constellation design methods to SCMA codebook. To reduce the design complexity, we also propose a symmetric codebook design. For all the proposed design approaches, the minimum Euclidean distance aims to be maximized.

This enables us to efficiently construct a tree graph from data, even if there is only a single data sample available. We also provide an error bound of the objective function when we use the same solution to approximate a cyclic graph.

We focus on the factors that determine the level of synchrony and frequency of the network response, as well as the effects of mild heterogeneity on network dynamics. With mild heterogeneity, synchrony is never perfect and is relatively fragile. In addition, the effects of inhibition are more complex in mildly heterogeneous networks than in homogeneous ones. In the former, synchrony is broken in two distinct ways, depending on the ratio of the synaptic decay time to the period of repetitive action potentials ($\tau_s/T$), where $T$ can be determined either from the network or from a single, self-inhibiting neuron. With $\tau_s/T > 2$, corresponding to large applied current, small synaptic strength or large synaptic decay time, the effects of inhibition are largely tonic and heterogeneous neurons spike relatively independently. With $\tau_s/T < 1$, synchrony breaks when faster cells begin to suppress their less excitable neighbors; cells that fire remain nearly synchronous.

Only in one portion of the parameter space, called `phasic', is the network period proportional to the synaptic decay time. These results are discussed in connection with previous work of the authors, which showed that for mildly heterogeneous networks, the synchrony breaks down, but coherence is preserved much more for systems in the phasic regime than in the other regimes.

In both areas the distribution of spike counts for each stimulus was well-described by a Gaussian, with the log of the variance in the spike count linearly related to the log of the mean spike count. Two significant differences in response characteristics were found: both the range of spike counts and the slope of the log(variance) vs. log(mean) regression were larger in V1 than in IT. However, neurons in the two areas transmitted approximately the same amount of information about the stimuli, and had about the same channel capacity (the maximum possible transmitted information given noise in the responses).

We derive closed-form expressions for the lower-bounds on the capacity of a simple model of a cortical synapse under two explicit coding paradigms. Under the ``signal estimation'' paradigm, we assume the signal to be encoded in the mean firing rate of a Poisson neuron. The performance of an optimal linear estimator of the signal then provides a lower bound on the capacity for signal estimation. Under the ``signal detection'' paradigm, the presence or absence of the signal has to be detected. Performance of the optimal spike detector allows us to compute a lower bound on the capacity for signal detection. We find that single synapses (for empirically measured parameter values) transmit information poorly but significant improvement can be achieved with a small amount of redundancy.",872,1998,"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 10, Michael I.

Sensory Coding with Dynamically Competitive Networks,"M. I. Rabinovich, R. Huerta, A. Volkovskii, Henry D. I. Abarbanel, G. Laurent",5,"Studies of insect olfactory processing indicate that odors are represented by rich spatio-temporal patterns of neural activity. These patterns are very difficult to predict a priori, yet they are stimulus specific and reliable upon repeated stimulation with the same input. We formulate here a theoretical framework in which we can interpret these experimental results. We propose a paradigm of ``dynamic competition'' in which inputs (odors) are represented by internally competing neural assemblies. Each pattern is the result of dynamical motion within the network and does not involve a ``winner'' among competing possibilities. The model produces spatio-temporal patterns with strong resemblance to those observed experimentally and possesses many of the general features one desires for pattern classifiers: large information capacity, reliability, specific responses to specific inputs, and reduced sensitivity to initial conditions or influence of noise. This form of neural processing may thus describe the organizational principles of neural information processing in sensory systems and go well beyond the observations on insect olfactory processing which motivated its development.",1193,1999,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,26.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0309033v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0309033v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0309033v2,q-bio/0309033v2
Temporal structure in neuronal activity during working memory in Macaque parietal cortex,"B. Pesaran, J. S. Pezaris, M. Sahani, P. P. Mitra, R. A. Andersen",5,"A number of cortical structures are reported to have elevated single unit firing rates sustained throughout the memory period of a working memory task. How the nervous system forms and maintains these memories is unknown but reverberating neuronal network activity is thought to be important. We studied the temporal structure of single unit (SU) activity and simultaneously recorded local field potential (LFP) activity from area LIP in the inferior parietal lobe of two awake macaques during a memory-saccade task. Using multitaper techniques for spectral analysis, which play an important role in obtaining the present results, we find elevations in spectral power in a 50--90 Hz (gamma) frequency band during the memory period in both SU and LFP activity. The activity is tuned to the direction of the saccade providing evidence for temporal structure that codes for movement plans during working memory. We also find SU and LFP activity are coherent during the memory period in the 50--90 Hz gamma band and no consistent relation is present during simple fixation. Finally, we find organized LFP activity in a 15--25 Hz frequency band that may be related to movement execution and preparatory aspects of the task. Neuronal activity could be used to control a neural prosthesis but SU activity can be hard to isolate with cortical implants. As the LFP is easier to acquire than SU activity, our finding of rich temporal structure in LFP activity related to movement planning and execution may accelerate the development of this medical application.",1552,2000,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,25.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0309034v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0309034v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0309034v1,q-bio/0309034v1

What do neural nets and quantum theory tell us about mind and reality?,Paul J. Werbos,1,"This paper proposes an approach to framing and answering fundamental questions about consciousness. It argues that many of the more theoretical debates about consciousness, such as debates about ""when does it begin?"", are misplaced and meaningless, in part because ""consciousness"" as a word has many valid and interesting definitions, and in part because consciousness qua mind or intelligence (the main focus here)is a matter of degree or level, not a binary variable. It proposes that new mathematical work related to functional neural network designs -- designs so functional that they can be used in engineering -- is essential to a functional understanding of intelligence as such, and outlines some key mathematics as of 1999, citing earlier work for more details.

Positive answer on this question is crucial, in particular, for consideration of brain neurons as quantum computers. This discussion was mainly based on theoretical arguments. In present paper nonlinear statistical properties of the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) of genetically depressive limbic brain are studied {\it in vivo} on the Flinders Sensitive Line of rats (FSL). VTA plays a key role in generation of pleasure and in development of psychological drug addiction. We found that the FSL VTA (dopaminergic) neuron signals exhibit multifractal properties for interspike frequencies on the scales where healthy VTA dopaminergic neurons exhibit bursting activity. For high moments the observed multifractal (generalized dimensions) spectrum coincides with the generalized dimensions spectrum calculated for a spectral measure of a {\it quantum} system (so-called kicked Harper model, actively used as a model of quantum chaos).

Ocular dominance patterns and the wire length minimization: a numerical study,"Alexei A. Koulakov, Dmitri B.

This model is based on the premise that ODP is an adaptation to minimize the length of intra-cortical wiring. Thus we attempt to understand the existing ODPs by solving a wire length minimization problem. We divide all the neurons into two classes: left- and right-eye dominated. We find that segregation of neurons into monocular regions reduces wire length if the number of connections to the neurons of the same class (intraocular) differs from the number of interocular connections. The shape of the regions depends on the relative fraction of neurons in the two classes. We find that if both classes are almost equally represented, the optimal ODP consists of interdigitating stripes. If one class is less numerous than the other, the optimal ODP consists of patches of the less abundant class surrounded by the neurons of the other class. We predict that the transition from stripes to patches occurs when the fraction of neurons dominated by the underrepresented eye is about 40%. This prediction agrees with the data in macaque and Cebus monkeys.

The hippocampal-entorhinal loop plays a double role in the unified model, it is part of a reconstruction network and a controller, too. This double role turns the bottom-up information flow into top-down control like signals. The role of bottom-up filtering is information maximization, noise filtering, temporal integration and prediction, whereas the role of top-down filtering is emphasizing, i.e., highlighting or `paving of the way' as well as context based pattern completion. In the joined model, the control task is performed by cortical areas, whereas reconstruction networks can be found between cortical areas. While the controller is highly non-linear, the reconstruction network is an almost linear architecture, which is optimized for noise estimation and noise filtering. A conjecture of the reconstruction network model -- that the long-term memory of the visual stream is the linear feedback connections between neocortical areas -- is reinforced by the joined model.

We investigate how do these subthreshold properties of neurons affect their suprathreshold response. Vice versa we ask: Can we distinguish between both types of neuronal dynamics using suprathreshold spike trains? The dynamics of neurons is given by stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo and Morris-Lecar models with either having a focus or a node as the stable fixpoint. We determine numerically the spectral power density as well as the interspike interval density in response to a random (noise-like) signals. We show that the information about the type of dynamics obtained from power spectra is of limited validity. In contrast, the interspike interval density gives a very sensitive instrument for the diagnostics of whether the dynamics has resonant or nonresonant properties. For the latter value we formulate a fit formula and use it to reconstruct theoretically the spectral power density, which coincides with the numerically obtained spectra.

Quantum Physics in Neuroscience and Psychology: A New Theory With Respect to Mind/Brain Interaction,"J. M. Schwartz, H. P. Stapp, M. Beauregard",3,"The cognitive frame in which most neuropsychological research on the neural basis of behavior is conducted contains the assumption that brain mechanisms per se fully suffice to explain all psychologically described phenomena. This assumption stems from the idea that the brain is made up entirely of material particles and fields, and that all causal mechanisms must therefore be formulated solely in terms of properties of these elements. One consequence of this stance is that psychological terms having intrinsic mentalistic and/or experiential content (terms such as ""feeling,"" ""knowing,"" and ""effort"") have not been included as primary causal factors in neuropsychological research: insofar as properties are not described in material terms they are deemed irrelevant to the causal mechanisms underlying brain function. However, the origin of this demand that experiential realities be excluded from the causal base is a theory of nature that has been known for more that three quarters of a century to be fundamentally incorrect. It is explained here why it is consequently scientifically unwarranted to assume that material factors alone can in principle explain all causal mechanisms relevant to neuroscience. More importantly, it is explained how a key quantum effect can be introduced into brain dynamics in a simple and practical way that provides a rationally coherent, causally formulated, physics-based way of understanding and using the psychological and physical data derived from the growing set of studies of the capacity of directed attention and mental effort to systematically alter brain function.",1619,2004,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,21.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0401019v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0401019v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0401019v1,q-bio/0401019v1

We derive reduced two-dimensional dynamics for the network, showing that a drastic shift of the fixed point from a winner-take-all state to an ""I don't know"" state occurs in accordance with the increase in noise added to the stored patterns.

The theory is complemented by a description of a numerical procedure for solving the mean-field equations quantitatively. With our treatment, we can determine self-consistently both the firing rates and the firing correlations, without being restricted to specific neuron models. Here, we solve the analytically derived mean-field equations numerically for integrate-and-fire neurons. Several known key properties of orientation selective cortical neurons emerge naturally from the description: Irregular firing with statistics close to -- but not restricted to -- Poisson statistics; an almost linear gain function (firing frequency as a function of stimulus contrast) of the neurons within the network; and a contrast-invariant tuning width of the neuronal firing. We find that the irregularity in firing depends sensitively on synaptic strengths. If Fano factors are bigger than 1, then they are so for all stimulus orientations that elicit firing.

General representation of collective neural dynamics with columnar modularity,"Myoung Won Cho, Seunghwan Kim",2,"We exhibit a mathematical framework to represent the neural dynamics at cortical level. Our description of neural dynamics with columnar and functional modularity, named fibre bundle representation (FBM) method, is based both on neuroscience and informatics, whereas they correspond with the conventional formulas in statistical physics. In spite of complex interactions in neural circuitry and various cortical modification rules per models, some significant factors determine the typical phenomena in cortical dynamics. The FBM representation method reveals them plainly and gives profit in building or analyzing the cortical dynamic models. Not only the similarity in formulas, the cortical dynamics can share the statistical properties with other physical systems, which validated in primary visual maps. We apply our method to proposed models in visual map formations, in addition our suggestion using the lateral interaction scheme.

Cortical Dynamics and Awareness State: An Interpretation of Observed Interstimulus Interval Dependence in Apparent Motion,"R. Englman, A. Yahalom",2,"In a recent paper on Cortical Dynamics, Francis and Grossberg raise the question how visual forms and motion information are integrated to generate a coherent percept of moving forms? In their investigation of illusory contours (which are, like Kanizsa squares, mental constructs rather than stimuli on the retina) they quantify the subjective impression of apparent motion between illusory contours that are formed by two subsequent stimuli with delay times of about 0.2 second (called the interstimulus interval ISI). The impression of apparent motion is due to a back referral of a later experience to an earlier time in the conscious representation. A model is developed which describes the state of awareness in the observer in terms of a time dependent Schroedinger equation to which a second order time derivative is added. This addition requires as boundary conditions the values of the solution both at the beginning and after the process. Satisfactory quantitative agreement is found between the results of the model and the experimental results. We recall that in the von Neumann interpretation of the collapse of the quantum mechanical wave-function, the collapse was associated with an observer's awareness.

We present a method to fit an Integrate-and-Fire-type model of neuronal activity, namely a modified version of the Spike Response Model, to a detailed Hodgkin-Huxley-type neuron model driven by stochastic spike arrival. In the Hogkin-Huxley model, spike arrival at the synapse is modeled by a change of synaptic conductance.

How to compute using globally coupled oscillators,"Peter Ashwin, Jon Borresen",2,Synchronization is known to play a vital role within many highly connected neural systems such as the olfactory systems of fish and insects. In this paper we show how one can robustly and effectively perform practical computations using small perturbations to a very simple globally coupled network of coupled oscillators. Computations are performed by exploiting the spatio-temporal dynamics of a robust attracting heteroclinic network (also referred to as `winnerless competition' dynamics). We use different cluster synchronization states to encode memory states and use this to design a simple multi-base counter. The simulations indicate that this gives a robust computational system exploiting the natural dynamics of the system.,735,2004,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,21.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0409012v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0409012v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0409012v1,q-bio/0409012v1

Theory of localized synfire chain,"Kosuke Hamaguchi, Masato Okada, Kazuyuki Aihara",3,"Neuron is a noisy information processing unit and conventional view is that information in the cortex is carried on the rate of neurons spike emission. More recent studies on the activity propagation through the homogeneous network have demonstrated that signals can be transmitted with millisecond fidelity; this model is called the Synfire chain and suggests the possibility of the spatio-temporal coding. However, the more biologically realistic, structured feedforward network generates spatially distributed inputs. It results in the difference of spike timing. This poses a question on how the spatial structure of a network effect the stability of spatio-temporal spike patterns, and the speed of a spike packet propagation. By formulating the Fokker-Planck equation for the feedforwardly coupled network with Mexican-Hat type connectivity, we show the stability of localized spike packet and existence of Multi-stable phase where both uniform and localized spike packets are stable depending on the initial input structure. The Multi-stable phase enables us to show that a spike pattern, or the information of its own, determines the propagation speed.",1160,2004,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,21.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0410014v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0410014v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0410014v1,q-bio/0410014v1
Stimulus competition by inhibitory interference,Paul H. Tiesinga,1,"When two stimuli are present in the receptive field of a V4 neuron, the firing rate response is between the weakest and strongest response elicited by each of the stimuli alone (Reynolds et al, 1999, Journal of Neuroscience 19:1736-1753). When attention is directed towards the stimulus eliciting the strongest response (the preferred stimulus), the response to the pair is increased, whereas the response decreases when attention is directed to the other stimulus (the poor stimulus). These experimental results were reproduced in a model of a V4 neuron under the assumption that attention modulates the activity of local interneuron networks. The V4 model neuron received stimulus-specific asynchronous excitation from V2 and synchronous inhibitory inputs from two local interneuron networks in V4. Each interneuron network was driven by stimulus-specific excitatory inputs from V2 and was modulated by a projection from the frontal eye fields. Stimulus competition was present because of a delay in arrival time of synchronous volleys from each interneuron network. For small delays, the firing rate was close to the rate elicited by the preferred stimulus alone, whereas for larger delays it approached the firing rate of the poor stimulus. When either stimulus was presented alone the neuron's response was not altered by the change in delay. The model suggests that top-down attention biases the competition between V2 columns for control of V4 neurons by changing the relative timing of inhibition rather than by changes in the degree of synchrony of interneuron networks. The mechanism proposed here for attentional modulation of firing rate - gain modulation by inhibitory interference - is likely to have more general applicability to cortical information processing.",1777,2004,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,21.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0410019v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0410019v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0410019v1,q-bio/0410019v1
Effect of Synchronous Incoming Spikes on Activity Pattern in A Network of Spiking Neurons,"Takaaki Aoki, Toshio Aoyagi",2,"Although recent neurophysiological experiments suggest that synchronous neural activity is involved in some perceptual and cognitive processes, the functional role of such coherent neuronal behavior is not well understood. As a first step in clarifying this role, we investigate how the temporal coherence of certain neuronal activity affects the activity pattern in a neural network. Using a simple network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, we study the effects of synchronized incoming spikes on the functioning of two mechanisms typically used in model neural systems, winner-take-all competition and associative memory. We demonstrate that a pair of switches undergone by the incoming spikes, from asynchronous to synchronous and then back to asynchronous, triggers a transition of the network from one state to another state. In the case of associative memory, for example, this switching controls the timing of the next recalling, whereas the firing rate pattern in the asynchronous state prepares the network for the next retrieval pattern.",1050,2004,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,21.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0410029v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0410029v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0410029v1,q-bio/0410029v1

The multivariate correlations of the joint scores were analysed using principal components analysis.   Results: The principal components were well-approximated by the sums and differences of the SQ and EQ scores. The differences in the scores corresponded to sex differences within the control group and also separated out the AS/HFA group, which showed stronger systemizing than the control group, but below-average empathy. The sums of the scores did not show sex differences, but did distinguish the AS/HFA group.

In the first paper they derived an expression for the stationary probability density of the membrane voltage; in the second paper this expression was modified to cover a larger parameter regime. Here we show by standard analysis of solvable limit cases (white-noise limit of additive and multiplicative noise sources; only slow multiplicative noise; only additive noise) and by numerical simulations that their first result does not hold for the general colored-noise case and uncover the errors made in the derivation of a Fokker-Planck equation for the probability density. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically (including an exact integral expression for the time-dependent mean value of the voltage) and by comparison to simulation results, that the extended expression for the probability density works much better but still does not solve exactly the full colored-noise problem. We also show that at stronger synaptic input the stationary mean value of the linear voltage model may diverge and give an exact condition relating the system parameters for which this takes place.",1344,2005,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,20.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0501038v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0501038v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0501038v2,q-bio/0501038v2
Autoassociative Memory Retrieval and Spontaneous Activity Bumps in Small-World Networks of Integrate-and-Fire Neurons,"A. Anishchenko, E. Bienenstock, A. Treves",3,"Qualitatively, some real networks in the brain could be characterized as 'small worlds', in the sense that the structure of their connections is intermediate between the extremes of an orderly geometric arrangement and of a geometry-independent random mesh. Small worlds can be defined more precisely in terms of their mean path length and clustering coefficient; but is such a precise description useful to better understand how the type of connectivity affects memory retrieval?   We have simulated an autoassociative memory network of integrate-and-fire units, positioned on a ring, with the network connectivity varied parametrically between ordered and random. We find that the network retrieves when the connectivity is close to random, and displays the characteristic behavior of ordered nets (localized 'bumps' of activity) when the connectivity is close to ordered. Recent analytical work shows that these two behaviours can coexist in a network of simple threshold-linear units, leading to localized retrieval states. We find that they tend to be mutually exclusive behaviours, however, with our integrate-and-fire units. Moreover, the transition between the two occurs for values of the connectivity parameter which are not simply related to the notion of small worlds.",1280,2005,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,20.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0502003v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0502003v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0502003v1,q-bio/0502003v1

We find that in terms of information buffering the network performs best for a moderate, non-zero, amount of noise. Analogous to the phenomenon of stochastic resonance the performance decreases for higher and lower noise levels. The optimal amount of noise corresponds to the transition zone between a quiescent state and a regime of stochastic dynamics.

If all network elements receive the same signal, signal buffering over delays comparable to the intrinsic time constant of the network elements can be explained by macroscopic properties and works best at the phase transition to chaos. However, if only 20 percent of the network units receive a common time-dependent signal, signal buffering properties improve and can no longer be attributed to the macroscopic dynamics.",778,2005,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,20.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0502031v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0502031v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0502031v1,q-bio/0502031v1
Optimal Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity for Precise Action Potential Firing,"Jean-Pascal Pfister, Taro Toyoizumi, David Barber, Wulfram Gerstner",4,"In timing-based neural codes, neurons have to emit action potentials at precise moments in time. We use a supervised learning paradigm to derive a synaptic update rule that optimizes via gradient ascent the likelihood of postsynaptic firing at one or several desired firing times. We find that the optimal strategy of up- and downregulating synaptic efficacies can be described by a two-phase learning window similar to that of Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). If the presynaptic spike arrives before the desired postsynaptic spike timing, our optimal learning rule predicts that the synapse should become potentiated. The dependence of the potentiation on spike timing directly reflects the time course of an excitatory postsynaptic potential.

The hypothesis explored here is that these observed effects of attention could be a consequence of changes in the synchrony of local interneuron networks. We performed computer simulations of a Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron driven by a constant depolarizing current, I, representing visual stimulation and a modulatory inhibitory input representing the effects of attention via local interneuron networks. We observed that the neuron's firing rate and the coherence of its output spike train with the synaptic inputs was modulated by the degree of synchrony of the inhibitory inputs.

Dynamics of learning in coupled oscillators tutored with delayed reinforcements,"Marcos A. Trevisan, Sebastian Bouzat, Ines Samengo, Gabriel B. Mindlin",4,"In this work we analyze the solutions of a simple system of coupled phase oscillators in which the connectivity is learned dynamically. The model is inspired in the process of learning of birdsong by oscine birds. An oscillator acts as the generator of a basic rhythm, and drives slave oscillators which are responsible for different motor actions. The driving signal arrives to each driven oscillator through two different pathways. One of them is a ""direct"" pathway. The other one is a ""reinforcement"" pathway, through which the signal arrives delayed. The coupling coefficients between the driving oscillator and the slave ones evolve in time following a Hebbian-like rule. We discuss the conditions under which a driven oscillator is capable of learning to lock to the driver.

In this paper, we utilize a modified version of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations to model the spatial propagation of neuron firing; we assume that this propagation is (at least, partially) caused by the cross-diffusion connection between the potential and recovery variables. We show that the cross-diffusion version of the model, besides giving rise to the typical fast traveling wave solution exhibited in the original diffusion Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations, also gives rise to a slow traveling wave solution.

The noise occurs on a very short-time scale compared to that for the neuron dynamics and it produces short-time synaptic depression. This is inspired in recent neurobiological findings that show that synaptic strength may either increase or decrease on a short-time scale depending on presynaptic activity. We thus describe a mechanism by which fast presynaptic noise enhances the neural network sensitivity to an external stimulus. The reason for this is that, in general, the presynaptic noise induces nonequilibrium behavior and, consequently, the space of fixed points is qualitatively modified in such a way that the system can easily scape from the attractor.

This is a consequence of activity-dependent synaptic fluctuations, which continuously destabilize the attractor and induce irregular hopping to other possible attractors. The nature of the resulting irregularity depends on the dynamic details, namely, on the intensity of the synaptic noise and on the number of sites of the network that are synchronously updated at each time step. Varying these details, different regimes occur from regular to chaotic. In the absence of external agents, the chaotic behavior may turn regular after tuning the noise intensity.

Context-dependent selection of visuomotor maps,Emilio Salinas,1,"Behavior results from the integration of ongoing sensory signals and contextual information in various forms, such as past experience, expectations, current goals, etc. Thus, the response to a specific stimulus, say the ringing of a doorbell, varies depending on whether you are at home or in someone else's house. What is the neural basis of this flexibility? What mechanism is capable of selecting, in a context-dependent way, an adequate response to a given stimulus? One possibility is based on a nonlinear neural representation in which context information regulates the gain of stimulus-evoked responses. Here I explore the properties of this mechanism. By means of three hypothetical visuomotor tasks, I study a class of neural network models in which any one of several possible stimulus-response maps or rules can be selected according to context. The underlying mechanism based on gain modulation has three key features: (1) modulating the sensory responses is equivalent to switching on or off different subpopulations of neurons, (2) context does not need to be represented continuously, although this is advantageous for generalization, and (3) context-dependent selection is independent of the discriminability of the stimuli. In all cases, the contextual cues can quickly turn on or off a sensory-motor map, effectively changing the functional connectivity between inputs and outputs in the networks. The model predicts that sensory responses that are nonlinearly modulated by arbitrary context signals should be found in behavioral situations that involve choosing or switching between multiple sensory-motor maps.",1630,2005,"BMC Neuroscience 5:47, 2005",arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,20.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0510037v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0510037v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0510037v1,q-bio/0510037v1
Stable Concurrent Synchronization in Dynamic System Networks,"Quang-Cuong Pham, Jean-Jacques Slotine",2,"In a network of dynamical systems, concurrent synchronization is a regime where multiple groups of fully synchronized elements coexist. In the brain, concurrent synchronization may occur at several scales, with multiple ``rhythms'' interacting and functional assemblies combining neural oscillators of many different types. Mathematically, stable concurrent synchronization corresponds to convergence to a flow-invariant linear subspace of the global state space. We derive a general condition for such convergence to occur globally and exponentially. We also show that, under mild conditions, global convergence to a concurrently synchronized regime is preserved under basic system combinations such as negative feedback or hierarchies, so that stable concurrently synchronized aggregates of arbitrary size can be constructed. Robustnesss of stable concurrent synchronization to variations in individual dynamics is also quantified.

Temporal correlation based learning in neuron models,Juergen Jost,1,"We study a learning rule based upon the temporal correlation (weighted by a learning kernel) between incoming spikes and the internal state of the postsynaptic neuron, building upon previous studies of spike timing dependent synaptic plasticity (\cite{KGvHW,KGvH1,vH}). Our learning rule for the synaptic weight $w_{ij}$ is $$ \dot w_{ij}(t)= \epsilon \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{T_l} \int_{t-T_l}^t \sum_\mu \delta(\tau+s-t_{j,\mu}) u(\tau) d\tau\ \Gamma(s)ds $$ where the $t_{j,\mu}$ are the arrival times of spikes from the presynaptic neuron $j$ and the function $u(t)$ describes the state of the postsynaptic neuron $i$. Thus, the spike-triggered average contained in the inner integral is weighted by a kernel $\Gamma(s)$, the learning window, positive for negative, negative for positive values of the time diffence $s$ between post- and presynaptic activity. An antisymmetry assumption for the learning window enables us to derive analytical expressions for a general class of neuron models and to study the changes in input-output relationships following from synaptic weight changes.

Attentional modulation of firing rate and synchrony in a model cortical network,"Calin Buia, Paul Tiesinga",2,"When attention is directed into the receptive field of a V4 neuron, its contrast response curve is shifted to lower contrast values (Reynolds et al, 2000, Neuron 26:703). Attention also increases the coherence between neurons responding to the same stimulus (Fries et al, 2001, Science 291:1560). We studied how the firing rate and synchrony of a densely interconnected cortical network varied with contrast and how they were modulated by attention. We found that an increased driving current to the excitatory neurons increased the overall firing rate of the network, whereas variation of the driving current to inhibitory neurons modulated the synchrony of the network. We explain the synchrony modulation in terms of a locking phenomenon during which the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory firing rates is approximately constant for a range of driving current values. We explored the hypothesis that contrast is represented primarily as a drive to the excitatory neurons, whereas attention corresponds to a reduction in driving current to the inhibitory neurons. Using this hypothesis, the model reproduces the following experimental observations: (1) the firing rate of the excitatory neurons increases with contrast; (2) for high contrast stimuli, the firing rate saturates and the network synchronizes; (3) attention shifts the contrast response curve to lower contrast values; (4) attention leads to stronger synchronization that starts at a lower value of the contrast compared with the attend-away condition. In addition, it predicts that attention increases the delay between the inhibitory and excitatory synchronous volleys produced by the network, allowing the stimulus to recruit more downstream neurons.",1717,2005,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,20.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0512021v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0512021v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0512021v2,q-bio/0512021v2
Contextual Emergence of Mental States from Neurodynamics,"H. Atmanspacher, P. beim Graben",2,"The emergence of mental states from neural states by partitioning the neural phase space is analyzed in terms of symbolic dynamics. Well-defined mental states provide contexts inducing a criterion of structural stability for the neurodynamics that can be implemented by particular partitions. This leads to distinguished subshifts of finite type that are either cyclic or irreducible. Cyclic shifts correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points or limit tori whereas irreducible shifts are obtained from generating partitions of mixing hyperbolic systems. These stability criteria are applied to the discussion of neural correlates of consiousness, to the definition of macroscopic neural states, and to aspects of the symbol grounding problem. In particular, it is shown that compatible mental descriptions, topologically equivalent to the neurodynamical description, emerge if the partition of the neural phase space is generating. If this is not the case, mental descriptions are incompatible or complementary.

Sleep as the solution to an optimization problem,Emmanuel Tannenbaum,1,"This paper develops a highly simplified model with which to analyze the phenomenon of sleep. Motivated by Crick's suggestion that sleep is the brain's way of ``taking out the trash,'' a suggestion that is supported by emerging evidence, we consider the problem of the filling and emptying of a tank. At any given time, the tank may take in external resource, or fill, if resource is available at that time, or it may empty. The filling phases correspond to information input from the environment, or input of some material in general, while the emptying phases correspond to the processing of the resource. Given a resource-availablility profile over some time interval $ T $, we develop a canonical algorithm for determining the fill-empty profile that produces the maximum quantity of processed resource at the end of the time interval. From this algorithm, it readily follows that for a periodically oscillating resource-availability profile, the optimal fill-empty strategy is given by a fill period when resource is available, followed by an empty period when resource is not. This cycling behavior is analogous to the wake-sleep cycles in organismal life, where the generally nocturnal sleep phase is a period where the information collected from the day's activities may be processed. The sleep cycle is then a mechanism for the organism to process a maximal amount of information over a daily cycle. Our model can exhibit phenomena analogous to ``microsleeps,'' and other behavior associated with breakdown in sleep patterns.",1533,2006,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,19.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0601008v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0601008v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0601008v1,q-bio/0601008v1

Concurrent encoding of frequency and amplitude modulation in human auditory cortex: MEG evidence,"Huan Luo, Yadong Wang, David Poeppel, Jonathan Z. Simon",4,"A natural sound can be described by dynamic changes in envelope (amplitude) and carrier (frequency), corresponding to amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) respectively. Although the neural responses to both AM and FM sounds are extensively studied in both animals and humans, it is uncertain how they are co-represented when changed simultaneously but independently, as is typical for ecologically natural signals. This study elucidates the neural coding of such sounds in human auditory cortex using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Using stimuli with both sinusoidal modulated envelope (f_{AM}, 37 Hz) and carrier frequency (f_{FM}, 0.3 - 8 Hz), it is demonstrated that AM and FM stimulus dynamics are co-represented in the neural code of human auditory cortex. The stimulus AM dynamics are represented neurally with AM encoding, by the auditory Steady State Response (aSSR) at f_{AM}. For sounds with slowly changing carrier frequency ((f_{FM} < 5 Hz), it is shown that the stimulus FM dynamics are tracked by the phase of the aSSR, demonstrating neural phase modulation (PM) encoding of the stimulus carrier frequency. For sounds with faster carrier frequency change ((f_{FM} >= 5 Hz), it is shown that modulation encoding of stimulus FM dynamics persists, but the neural encoding is no longer purely PM. This result is consistent with the recruitment of additional neural AM encoding over and above the original neural PM encoding, indicating that both the amplitude and phase of the aSSR at f_{AM} track the stimulus FM dynamics.

We show that, contrary to the general impression, a GM-cell representation can be information-theoretically efficient, but that it must be accompanied by cells giving a distributed coding of the input. We present a general method to deduce the sparsity distribution of the whole neuronal population from a sample, and use it to show there are two populations of cells: a distributed-code population of less than about 5% of the cells, and a much more sparsely responding population of putative GM cells. With an allowance for the number of undetected silent cells, we find that the putative GM cells can code for 10^5 or more categories, sufficient for them to be classic GM cells, or to be GM-like cells coding for memories.

In this model distinct odorants activate specific subsets of glomeruli, dependent upon the odorant's chemical identity and concentration. The glomerular response specificities are understood statistically, based on experimentally measured distributions of detection thresholds. A simple version of the model, in which glomerular responses are binary (the on/off model), allows us to account quantitatively for the following results of human/rodent olfactory psychophysics: 1) just noticeable differences in the perceived concentration of a single odor (Weber ratios) are dC/C ~ 0.04; 2) the number of simultaneously perceived odors can be as high as 12; 3) extensive lesions of the olfactory bulb do not lead to significant changes in detection or discrimination thresholds.

Synaptic plasticity of Inhibitory synapse promote synchrony in inhibitory network in presence of heterogeneity and noise,Sachin S Talathi,1,Recently spike timing dependent plasticity was observed in inhibitory synapse in the layer II of entorhinal cortex. The rule provides an interesting zero in the region of $\Delta t=t_{post}-t_{pre}=0$ and in addition the dynamic range of the rule lie in gamma frequency band. We propose a robust mechanism based on this observed synaptic plasticity rule for inhibitory synapses for two mutually coupled interneurons to phase lock in synchrony in the presence of intrisic heterogeneity in firing. We study the stability of the phase locked solution by defining a map for spike times dependent on the phase response curve for the coupled neurons.

We extend a previous work that only considers synaptic depression as the most important mechanism in the transmission of information through synapses, to a more general situation including also synaptic facilitation. Our study shows that: 1) facilitation enhances the detection of correlated signals arriving from a subset of presynaptic excitatory neurons, with different degrees of correlation among this subset, and 2) the presence of facilitation allows for a better detection of firing rate changes. Finally, we also observed that facilitation determines the existence of an optimal input frequency which allows the best performance for a wide (maximum) range of the neuron firing threshold.

One finds that the transition frequency matrix between patterns shows non-trivial statistical properties in the chaotic itinerant regime. We show that mixture input patterns can be temporally segmented by the itinerant dynamics.

Our results are obtained for two kinds of neuronal models, leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons and Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons with five conductances. Over a range of parameters such as the maximum synaptic conductance, both kinds of chains are found to have multiple attractors of propagating bursts, with each attractor being distinguished by the number of spikes and total duration of the propagating burst.

With this in mind, we study the response of neurons to pulsed input trains whose frequency varies continuously in time, and observe that the receiving neuron synchronizes episodically to the input pulses, whenever the pulse frequency lies within the neuron's locking range. We propose this behavior as a mechanism of rate-code detection in neuronal populations.

Theory of Interaction of Memory Patterns in Layered Associative Networks,"Kazuya Ishibashi, Kosuke Hamaguchi, Masato Okada",3,"A synfire chain is a network that can generate repeated spike patterns with millisecond precision. Although synfire chains with only one activity propagation mode have been intensively analyzed with several neuron models, those with several stable propagation modes have not been thoroughly investigated. By using the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model, we constructed a layered associative network embedded with memory patterns. We analyzed the network dynamics with the Fokker-Planck equation. First, we addressed the stability of one memory pattern as a propagating spike volley. We showed that memory patterns propagate as pulse packets. Second, we investigated the activity when we activated two different memory patterns. Simultaneous activation of two memory patterns with the same strength led the propagating pattern to a mixed state. In contrast, when the activations had different strengths, the pulse packet converged to a two-peak state. Finally, we studied the effect of the preceding pulse packet on the following pulse packet. The following pulse packet was modified from its original activated memory pattern, and it converged to a two-peak state, mixed state or non-spike state depending on the time interval.",1230,2006,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,19.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0605022v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0605022v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0605022v1,q-bio/0605022v1

Neural integrator - a sandpile model,"Maxim Nikitchenko, Alexei Koulakov",2,"We investigated a model for the neural integrator based on hysteretic units connected by positive feedback. Hysteresis is assumed to emerge from the intrinsic properties of the cells. We consider the recurrent networks containing either bistable or multistable neurons. We apply our analysis to the oculomotor velocity-to-position neural integrator that calculates the eye positions from the inputs that carry information about eye angular velocity. Using the analysis of the system in the parameter space we show the following. The direction of hysteresis in the neuronal response may be reversed for the system with recurrent connections compared to the case of unconnected neurons. Thus, for the NMDA receptor based bistability the firing rates after ON saccades may be higher than after OFF saccades for the same eye position. We suggest that this is an emergent property due to the presence of global recurrent feedback. The reversal of hysteresis occurs only when the size of hysteresis differs from neuron to neuron. We also relate the macroscopic leak time-constant of the integrator to the rate of microscopic spontaneous noise-driven transitions in the hysteretic units. Finally, we argue that the presence of neurons with small hysteresis may remove the threshold for integration.",1291,2006,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,19.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0605038v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0605038v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0605038v1,q-bio/0605038v1

We interpret measured dMEC properties within the framework of a residue number system (RNS), and describe how RNS encoding -- which breaks the non-periodic variable of rat position into a set of narrowly distributed periodic variables -- allows a small set of cells to compactly represent and efficiently update rat position with high resolution over a large range. We show that the uniquely useful properties of RNS encoding still hold when the encoded and encoding quantities are relaxed to be real numbers with built-in uncertainties, and provide a numerical and functional estimate of the range and resolution of rat positions that can be uniquely encoded in dMEC. The use of a compact, `arithmetic-friendly' numeral system to encode a metric variable, as we propose is happening in dMEC, is qualitatively different from all previously identified examples of coding in the brain.

The entry into the reactivation phase is mediated through a physiologically feasible regulation of global excitability and external input sources, while the reactivated component of the network is formed through induced network heterogeneities during learning.

Learning with incomplete information - and the mathematical structure behind it,"Reimer Kuehn, Ion-Olimpiu Stamatescu",2,"Learning and the ability to learn are important factors in development and evolutionary processes [1]. Depending on the level, the complexity of learning can strongly vary. While associative learning can explain simple learning behaviour [1,2] much more sophisticated strategies seem to be involved in complex learning tasks. This is particularly evident in machine learning theory [3] (reinforcement learning [4], statistical learning [5]), but it equally shows up in trying to model natural learning behaviour [2]. A general setting for modelling learning processes in which statistical aspects are relevant is provided by the neural network (NN) paradigm. This is in particular of interest for natural, learning by experience situations. NN learning models can incorporate elementary learning mechanisms based on neuro-physiological analogies, such as the Hebb rule, and lead to quantitative results concerning the dynamics of the learning process [6]. The Hebb rule, however, cannot be directly applied in all cases, and in particular for realistic problems, such as ""delayed reinforcement"" [4,6], the sophistication of the algorithms rapidly increases. We want to present here a model which can cope with such non trivial tasks, while still being elementary and based only on procedures which one may think of as natural, without any appeal to higher strategies [7]. We can show the capability of this model to provide good learning in many, very different settings [7,8,9].

Hopfield,1,"The algorithms that simple feedback neural circuits representing a brain area can rapidly carry out are often adequate to solve only easy problems, and for more difficult problems can return incorrect answers. A new excitatory-inhibitory circuit model of associative memory displays the common human problem of failing to rapidly find a memory when only a small clue is present. The memory model and a related computational network for solving Sudoku puzzles produce answers that contain implicit check-bits in the representation of information across neurons, allowing a rapid evaluation of whether the putative answer is correct or incorrect through a computation related to visual 'pop-out'. This fact may account for our strong psychological feeling of right or wrong when we retrieve a nominal memory from a minimal clue. This information allows more difficult computations or memory retrievals to be done in a serial fashion by using the fast but limited capabilities of a computational module multiple times.

Calculating event-triggered average synaptic conductances from the membrane potential,"Martin Pospischil, Zuzanna Piwkowska, Michelle Rudolph, Thierry Bal, Alain Destexhe",5,"The optimal patterns of synaptic conductances for spike generation in central neurons is a subject of considerable interest. Ideally, such conductance time courses should be extracted from membrane potential (Vm) activity, but this is difficult because the nonlinear contribution of conductances to the Vm renders their estimation from the membrane equation extremely sensitive. We outline here a solution to this problem based on a discretization of the time axis. This procedure can extract the time course of excitatory and inhibitory conductances solely from the analysis of Vm activity.

"Brain, Music and non-Poisson Renewal Processes","Simone Bianco, Massimiliano Ignaccolo, Mark S. Rider, Mary J. Ross, Phil Winsor, Paolo Grigolini",6,"In this paper we show that both music composition and brain function, as revealed by the Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis, are renewal non-Poisson processes living in the non-ergodic dominion. To reach this important conclusion we process the data with the minimum spanning tree method, so as to detect significant events, thereby building a sequence of times, which is the time series to analyze. Then we show that in both cases, EEG and music composition, these significant events are the signature of a non-Poisson renewal process. This conclusion is reached using a techniques of statistical analysis recently developed by our group, the Aging Experiment (AE). First, we find that in both cases the distances between two consecutive events are described by non-exponential histograms, thereby proving the non-Poisson nature of these processes. The corresponding survival probabilities $\Psi(t)$ are well fitted by stretched exponentials ($\Psi(t) \propto exp(-(\gamma t)^\alpha$), with $0.5 <\alpha <1$.) The second step rests on the adoption of the AE, which shows that these are renewal processes. We show that the renewal stretched exponential is the emerging tip of an iceberg, whose underwater part has slow tails with an inverse power law structure with power index $\mu = 1 + \alpha$. We find that both EEG and music composition yield $\mu < 2$. On the basis of the recently discovered complexity matching effect, according to which a complex system $S$ with $\mu_S < 2$ responds only to a complex driving signal $P$ with $\mu_P = \mu_S$, we conclude that the results of our analysis may explain the influence of music on human brain.",1648,2006,,arXiv Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),0,0,0,0,19.5,Neurons and Cognition (Bioinformatics),q-bio.NC,https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0610037v3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0610037v3.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0610037v3,q-bio/0610037v3

We show that triangular arbitrage opportunities do exist, but that most have short durations and small magnitudes. We find intra-day variations in the number and length of arbitrage opportunities, with larger numbers of opportunities with shorter mean durations occurring during more liquid hours. We demonstrate further that the number of arbitrage opportunities has decreased in recent years, implying a corresponding increase in pricing efficiency. Using trading simulations, we show that a trader would need to beat other market participants to an unfeasibly large proportion of arbitrage prices to profit from triangular arbitrage over a prolonged period of time.

Both the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite and Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component indexes exhibited such behavior in two distinct time periods: 1) from mid-2005, bursting in Oct. 2007 and 2) from Nov. 2008, bursting in the beginning of Aug. 2009. We successfully predicted time windows for both crashes in advance with the same methods used to successfully predict the peak in mid-2006 of the US housing bubble and the peak in July 2008 of the global oil bubble. The more recent bubble in the Chinese indexes was detected and its end or change of regime was predicted independently by two groups with similar results, showing that the model has been well-documented and can be replicated by industrial practitioners.

Universal and nonuniversal allometric scaling behaviors in the visibility graphs of world stock market indices,"Meng-Cen Qian, Zhi-Qiang Jiang, Wei-Xing Zhou",3,"The investigations of financial markets from a complex network perspective have unveiled many phenomenological properties, in which the majority of these studies map the financial markets into one complex network. In this work, we investigate 30 world stock market indices through their visibility graphs by adopting the visibility algorithm to convert each single stock index into one visibility graph. A universal allometric scaling law is uncovered in the minimal spanning trees, whose scaling exponent is independent of the stock market and the length of the stock index. In contrast, the maximal spanning trees and the random spanning trees do not exhibit universal allometric scaling behaviors. There are marked discrepancies in the allometric scaling behaviors between the stock indices and the Brownian motions. Using surrogate time series, we find that these discrepancies are caused by the fat-tailedness of the return distribution, the nonlinear long-term correlation, and a coupling effect between these two influence factors.",1038,2009,J.

Statistical Regularities of Equity Market Activity,"Fengzhong Wang, Kazuko Yamasaki, Shlomo Havlin, H. Eugene Stanley",4,"Equity activity is an essential topic for financial market studies. To explore its statistical regularities, we comprehensively examine the trading value, a measure of the equity activity, of the 3314 most-traded stocks in the U.S. equity market and find that (i) the trading values follow a log-normal distribution; (ii) the standard deviation of the growth rate of the trading value obeys a power-law with the initial trading value, and the power-law exponent beta=0.14. Remarkably, both features hold for a wide range of sampling intervals, from 5 minutes to 20 trading days. Further, we show that all the 3314 stocks have long-term correlations, and their Hurst exponents H follow a normal distribution. Furthermore, we find that the Hurst exponent depends on the size of the company.

However, the determinants of superfamily classification are unclear. We attack this problem by studying the influence of linear temporal correlations and multifractality using fractional Brownian motions (FBMs) and multifractal random walks (MRWs). Numerical investigations unveil that the classification of superfamily phenomenon is uniquely determined by the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) scaling exponent $\alpha$ of the time series. Only four motif patterns are observed in the simulated data, which are delimited by three DFA scaling exponents $\alpha \simeq 0.25$, $\alpha \simeq 0.35$ and $\alpha \simeq 0.45$.

Finite-size effect and the components of multifractality in financial volatility,Wei-Xing Zhou,1,"Many financial variables are found to exhibit multifractal nature, which is usually attributed to the influence of temporal correlations and fat-tailedness in the probability distribution (PDF). Based on the partition function approach of multifractal analysis, we show that there is a marked finite-size effect in the detection of multifractality, and the effective multifractality is the apparent multifractality after removing the finite-size effect. We find that the effective multifractality can be further decomposed into two components, the PDF component and the nonlinearity component. Referring to the normal distribution, we can determine the PDF component by comparing the effective multifractality of the original time series and the surrogate data that have a normal distribution and keep the same linear and nonlinear correlations as the original data. We demonstrate our method by taking the daily volatility data of Dow Jones Industrial Average from 26 May 1896 to 27 April 2007 as an example. Extensive numerical experiments show that a time series exhibits effective multifractality only if it possesses nonlinearity and the PDF has impact on the effective multifractality only when the time series possesses nonlinearity. Our method can also be applied to judge the presence of multifractality and determine its components of multifractal time series in other complex systems.",1395,2009,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals 45 (2), 147-155 (2012)",arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,16.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.4782v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.4782v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.4782v1,0912.4782v1
Universal patterns of inequality,"Anand Banerjee, Victor M. Yakovenko",2,"Probability distributions of money, income, and energy consumption per capita are studied for ensembles of economic agents. The principle of entropy maximization for partitioning of a limited resource gives exponential distributions for the investigated variables. A non-equilibrium difference of money temperatures between different systems generates net fluxes of money and population. To describe income distribution, a stochastic process with additive and multiplicative components is introduced. The resultant distribution interpolates between exponential at the low end and power law at the high end, in agreement with the empirical data for USA. We show that the increase of income inequality in USA originates primarily from the increase of the income fraction going to the upper tail, which now exceeds 20% of the total income. Analyzing the data from the World Resources Institute, we find that the distribution of energy consumption per capita around the world can be approximately described by the exponential function.

Although approximately correct, this model fails to explain the frequent occurrence of extreme price movements, such as stock market crashes. Using a large collection of data from three different stock markets, we present evidence that a modification to the random model -- adding a slow, but significant, fluctuation to the standard deviation of the process -- accurately explains the probability of different-sized price changes, including the relative high frequency of extreme movements. Furthermore, we show that this process is similar across stocks so that their price fluctuations can be characterized by a single curve.

The presented models are the Lee-Carter and log-Poisson methods respectively. The low number of people subjected to risk, particularly noticed for the persons who are getting on, implies the use of an extrapolation method for the mortality rates. The Lee-Carter and log-Poisson methods constitute twodimensional models, taking the year and the age into account to calculate the mortality rates. The methods suggested are applied to a real data set. The prospective tables, built in this way, allow to project the rates' evolution in the future, extrapolating the temporal constituent. And then, it allows to compare this projection with the evolution predicted for the French population in its entirety. You determine the best method through the nearness of the smoothed rates in comparison with the raw rates and essentially through the caution of these models for the life annuities' calculation.

"Analyzing the prices of the most expensive sheet iron all over the world: Modeling, prediction and regime change","Fu-Tie Song, Wei-Xing Zhou",2,"The private car license plates issued in Shanghai are bestowed the title of ""the most expensive sheet iron all over the world"", more expensive than gold. A citizen has to bid in an monthly auction to obtain a license plate for his new private car. We perform statistical analysis to investigate the influence of the minimal price $P_{\min}$ of the bidding winners, the quota $N_{\rm{quota}}$ of private car license plates, the number $N_{\rm{bidder}}$ of bidders, as well as two external shocks including the legality debate of the auction in 2004 and the auction regime reform in January 2008 on the average price $P_{\rm{mean}}$ of all bidding winners. It is found that the legality debate of the auction had marginal transient impact on the average price in a short time period. In contrast, the change of the auction rules has significant permanent influence on the average price, which reduces the price by about 3020 yuan Renminbi. It means that the average price exhibits nonlinear behaviors with a regime change. The evolution of the average price is independent of the number $N_{\rm{bidder}}$ of bidders in both regimes. In the early regime before January 2008, the average price $P_{\rm{mean}}$ was influenced only by the minimal price $P_{\min}$ in the preceding month with a positive correlation. In the current regime since January 2008, the average price is positively correlated with the minimal price and the quota in the preceding month and negatively correlated with the quota in the same month. We test the predictive power of the two models using 2-year and 3-year moving windows and find that the latter outperforms the former.

Cross-Correlation Dynamics in Financial Time Series,"Thomas Conlon, Heather J. Ruskin, Martin Crane",3,"The dynamics of the equal-time cross-correlation matrix of multivariate financial time series is explored by examination of the eigenvalue spectrum over sliding time windows. Empirical results for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 indices reveal that the dynamics of the small eigenvalues of the cross-correlation matrix, over these time windows, oppose those of the largest eigenvalue. This behaviour is shown to be independent of the size of the time window and the number of stocks examined.   A basic one-factor model is then proposed, which captures the main dynamical features of the eigenvalue spectrum of the empirical data. Through the addition of perturbations to the one-factor model, (leading to a 'market plus sectors' model), additional sectoral features are added, resulting in an Inverse Participation Ratio comparable to that found for empirical data. By partitioning the eigenvalue time series, we then show that negative index returns, (drawdowns), are associated with periods where the largest eigenvalue is greatest, while positive index returns, (drawups), are associated with periods where the largest eigenvalue is smallest.

Testing for financial crashes using the Log Periodic Power Law mode,"David S. Bree, Nathan Lael Joseph",2,"A number of papers claim that a Log Periodic Power Law (LPPL) fitted to financial market bubbles that precede large market falls or 'crashes', contain parameters that are confined within certain ranges. The mechanism that has been claimed as underlying the LPPL, is based on influence percolation and a martingale condition. This paper examines these claims and the robustness of the LPPL for capturing large falls in the Hang Seng stock market index, over a 30-year period, including the current global downturn. We identify 11 crashes on the Hang Seng market over the period 1970 to 2008. The fitted LPPLs have parameter values within the ranges specified post hoc by Johansen and Sornette (2001) for only seven of these crashes. Interestingly, the LPPL fit could have predicted the substantial fall in the Hang Seng index during the recent global downturn. We also find that influence percolation combined with a martingale condition holds for only half of the pre-crash bubbles previously reported. Overall, the mechanism posited as underlying the LPPL does not do so, and the data used to support the fit of the LPPL to bubbles does so only partially.",1156,2010,,arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,15.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1010v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.1010v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1010v2,1002.1010v2

Based on the records of order matching among investors, we can construct a stock trading network for each trading day, in which the investors are mapped into nodes and each transaction is translated as a direct edge from the seller to the buyer with the trade size as its weight.

We investigate the distributions of one-minute intraday returns of all the A-share stocks traded in the Chinese stock market, which is the largest emerging market in the world. We find that the returns can be well fitted by the $q$-Gaussian distribution and the tails have power-law relaxations with the exponents fluctuating around $\alpha=3$ and being well outside the L\'evy stable regime for individual stocks. We provide statistically significant evidence showing that the exponents logarithmically decrease with the turnover rate and increase with the market capitalization, and find that the market capitalization has a greater impact on the tail exponent than the turnover rate.

Using the ultrahigh-frequency data of a liquid Chinese stock and its associated warrant, we perform a comparative investigation of the statistical properties of their intertrade duration time series. The distributions of the two equities can be better described by the shifted power-law form than the Weibull and their scaled distributions do not collapse onto a single curve. Although the intertrade durations of the two equities have very different magnitude, their intraday patterns exhibit very similar shapes.

We find that while Student copulas provide a good approximation for strongly correlated pairs of stocks, systematic discrepancies appear as the linear correlation between stocks decreases, that rule out all elliptical models. Intuitively, the failure of elliptical models can be traced to the inadequacy of the assumption of a single volatility mode for all stocks.

Tick size and price diffusion,"Gabriele La Spada, J. Doyne Farmer, Fabrizio Lillo",3,"A tick size is the smallest increment of a security price. It is clear that at the shortest time scale on which individual orders are placed the tick size has a major role which affects where limit orders can be placed, the bid-ask spread, etc. This is the realm of market microstructure and there is a vast literature on the role of tick size on market microstructure. However, tick size can also affect price properties at longer time scales, and relatively less is known about the effect of tick size on the statistical properties of prices. The present paper is divided in two parts. In the first we review the effect of tick size change on the market microstructure and the diffusion properties of prices. The second part presents original results obtained by investigating the tick size changes occurring at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We show that tick size change has three effects on price diffusion. First, as already shown in the literature, tick size affects price return distribution at an aggregate time scale. Second, reducing the tick size typically leads to an increase of volatility clustering. We give a possible mechanistic explanation for this effect, but clearly more investigation is needed to understand the origin of this relation. Third, we explicitly show that the ability of the subordination hypothesis in explaining fat tails of returns and volatility clustering is strongly dependent on tick size. While for large tick sizes the subordination hypothesis has significant explanatory power, for small tick sizes we show that subordination is not the main driver of these two important stylized facts of financial market.",1657,2010,,arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,15.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2329v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.2329v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2329v2,1009.2329v2
Individual and collective stock dynamics: intra-day seasonalities,"Romain Allez, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud",2,"We establish several new stylised facts concerning the intra-day seasonalities of stock dynamics. Beyond the well known U-shaped pattern of the volatility, we find that the average correlation between stocks increases throughout the day, leading to a smaller relative dispersion between stocks. Somewhat paradoxically, the kurtosis (a measure of volatility surprises) reaches a minimum at the open of the market, when the volatility is at its peak. We confirm that the dispersion kurtosis is a markedly decreasing function of the index return. This means that during large market swings, the idiosyncratic component of the stock dynamics becomes sub-dominant. In a nutshell, early hours of trading are dominated by idiosyncratic or sector specific effects with little surprises, whereas the influence of the market factor increases throughout the day, and surprises become more frequent.",887,2010,New J.

Financial LPPL Bubbles with Mean-Reverting Noise in the Frequency Domain,Vincenzo Liberatore,1,"The log-periodic power law (LPPL) is a model of asset prices during endogenous bubbles. A major open issue is to verify the presence of LPPL in price sequences and to estimate the LPPL parameters. Estimation is complicated by the fact that daily LPPL returns are typically orders of magnitude smaller than measured price returns, suggesting that noise obscures the underlying LPPL dynamics. However, if noise is mean-reverting, it would quickly cancel out over subsequent measurements. In this paper, we attempt to reject mean-reverting noise from price sequences by exploiting frequency-domain properties of LPPL and of mean reversion. First, we calculate the spectrum of mean-reverting \ou noise and devise estimators for the noise's parameters. Then, we derive the LPPL spectrum by breaking it down into its two main characteristics of power law and of log-periodicity. We compare price spectra with noise spectra during historical bubbles. In general, noise was strong also at low frequencies and, even if LPPL underlied price dynamics, LPPL would be obscured by noise.",1073,2010,,arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,15.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4835v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.4835v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4835v2,1009.4835v2

We find that the eigenvalue distribution of original correlation matrix deviates from the eigenvalues predicted by the RMT, and the largest eigenvalue is 52 times larger than the maximum value among the eigenvalues predicted by the RMT. The $\beta_{473}$ coefficient, which reflect the largest eigenvalue property, is 0.8, while one of the eigenvalues in the RMT is approximately zero. Notably, we show that the entropy function $E(\sigma)$ with the portfolio risk $\sigma$ for the original and filtered correlation matrices are consistent with a power-law function, $E(\sigma) \sim \sigma^{-\gamma}$, with the exponent $\gamma \sim 2.92$ and those for Asian currency crisis decreases significantly.",1050,2010,"Eur.

Market panic on different time-scales,"Lisa Borland, Yoan Hassid",2,"Cross-sectional signatures of market panic were recently discussed on daily time scales in [1], extended here to a study of cross-sectional properties of stocks on intra-day time scales. We confirm specific intra-day patterns of dispersion and kurtosis, and find that the correlation across stocks increases in times of panic yielding a bimodal distribution for the sum of signs of returns. We also find that there is memory in correlations, decaying as a power law with exponent 0.05. During the Flash-Crash of May 6 2010, we find a drastic increase in dispersion in conjunction with increased correlations. However, the kurtosis decreases only slightly in contrast to findings on daily time-scales where kurtosis drops drastically in times of panic. Our study indicates that this difference in behavior is result of the origin of the panic-inducing volatility shock: the more correlated across stocks the shock is, the more the kurtosis will decrease; the more idiosyncratic the shock, the lesser this effect and kurtosis is positively correlated with dispersion. We also find that there is a leverage effect for correlations: negative returns tend to precede an increase in correlations.

Upward trends, on the other hand, also increase the average correlation between stocks but rotates the corresponding market mode {\it away} from uniformity. There are two time scales associated to these effects, a short one on the order of a month (20 trading days), and a longer time scale on the order of a year.

The securities were all put in one portfolio in order to diversify away the firm-specific part of returns thereby enhancing the precision of the beta estimates. This paper should be of interest to both Ugandan and non-Ugandan investors and market researchers. While many developing countries have legal restrictions against foreign participation in capital and money markets, this is not so in Uganda, where it has become part of government policy to encourage foreign capital in flow, inorder to stimulate the development of the small and underdeveloped markets.   The Black, Jensen, and Scholes (1972) CAPM version is examined in this article. This version predicts a non zero-beta rate, along with the relation of higher returns to higher risk. The estimated zero-beta rate obtained is not statistically different from zero, and the estimated portfolio beta coefficient is statistically significant, providing evidence that the traditional form of CAPM holds on the USE, albeit having a beta coefficient that is not good at explaining the relationship between risk and return.",1574,2010,,arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,15.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.0184v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.0184v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.0184v1,1101.0184v1

Linkages within the REIT sector and with related sectors such as value stocks are diminished, while the general influence of market sentiment, coming through the large cap indices is enhanced. This would indicate that on a daily basis general market sentiment plays a more fundamental role than more intuitive relationships within the capital markets.",845,2011,,arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,14.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5417v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.5417v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5417v1,1103.5417v1
Uncovering Long Memory in High Frequency UK Futures,John Cotter,1,"Accurate volatility modelling is paramount for optimal risk management practices. One stylized feature of financial volatility that impacts the modelling process is long memory explored in this paper for alternative risk measures, observed absolute and squared returns for high frequency intraday UK futures. Volatility series for three different asset types, using stock index, interest rate and bond futures are analysed. Long memory is strongest for the bond contract. Long memory is always strongest for the absolute returns series and at a power transformation of k < 1. The long memory findings generally incorporate intraday periodicity. The APARCH model incorporating seven related GARCH processes generally models the futures series adequately documenting ARCH, GARCH and leverage effects.",798,2011,,arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,14.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5651v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.5651v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5651v1,1103.5651v1

Multivariate Modeling of Daily REIT Volatility,"John Cotter, Simon Stevenson",2,This paper examines volatility in REITs using a multivariate GARCH based model. The Multivariate VAR-GARCH technique documents the return and volatility linkages between REIT sub-sectors and also examines the influence of other US equity series. The motivation is for investors to incorporate time-varyng volatility and correlations in their portfolio selection. The results illustrate the differences in results when higher frequency daily data is tested in comparison to the monthly data that has been commonly used in the existing literature. The linkages both within the REIT sector and between REITs and related sectors such as value stocks are weaker than commonly found in monthly studies. The broad market would appear to be more influential in the daily case.,768,2011,,arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,14.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5660v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.5660v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5660v1,1103.5660v1

The near-extreme density of intraday log-returns,"Mauro Politi, Nicolas Millot, Anirban Chakraborti",3,"The extreme event statistics plays a very important role in the theory and practice of time series analysis. The reassembly of classical theoretical results is often undermined by non-stationarity and dependence between increments. Furthermore, the convergence to the limit distributions can be slow, requiring a huge amount of records to obtain significant statistics, and thus limiting its practical applications. Focussing, instead, on the closely related density of ""near-extremes"" -- the distance between a record and the maximal value -- can render the statistical methods to be more suitable in the practical applications and/or validations of models.

The Second Wave of the Global Crisis? A Log-Periodic Oscillation Analysis of Commodity Price Series,"Askar Akaev, Alexei Fomin, Andrey Korotayev",3,"This article continues our analysis of the gold price dynamics that was published in December 2010 (abs/1012.4118) and forecasted the possibility of the ""burst of the gold bubble"" in April - June 2011. Our recent analysis suggests the possibility of one more substantial fluctuation before the final collapse in July 2011. On the other hand, in early 2011 we detected a number of other commodity bubbles and forecasted the start of their collapse in May - June 2011. We demonstrate that this collapse has actually begun, which in conjunction with the forthcoming burst of the gold bubble suggests that the World System is entering a bifurcation zone bearing rather high risks of the second wave of the global financial-economic crisis. Indeed, on the one hand, it is obvious that such a collapse may lead to huge losses or even bankruptcies of many of the major participants of exchange games and their dependent firms and banks. Therefore, the immediate market reaction is likely to be entirely negative. Negative impact on the market could well be amplified by numerous publications in the media and business press, drawing analogies with the events of the early 1980s and earlier similar events, as well as by losses of shareholders of bankrupt companies. On the other hand, investments in gold also lead to the diversion of funds from stock market investments and to the reduction in the production of goods and services. If at the time of the collapse some promising areas of investment appear in the developed and / or developing countries, the investment can move to those markets, which, on the contrary, could contribute to the production of new goods and services and accelerate the way out of the crisis. It is also obvious that the decline of the oil (and other energy/mineral resources) prices may contribute to acceleration of world economic growth rates and world economic recovery.",1897,2011,,arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,14.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0480v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.0480v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0480v1,1107.0480v1

Of course, this is not a general proof of statistical inference, as we focus on one particular example and the generality of the process can not be claimed. Therefore, we produce other examples on a completely different markets, largely uncorrelated to the Euro future, namely the DAX and Cacao future contracts. The same procedure is followed using a trading system, based on the same ingredients. We show that similar results can be obtained and we conclude that this is an evidence that some invariants, as encoded in our system, have been identified.

Intermittency in Quantitative Finance,Laurent Schoeffel,1,"Factorial moments are convenient tools in nuclear physics to characterize the multiplicity distributions when phase-space resolution ($\Delta$) becomes small. For uncorrelated particle production within $\Delta$, Gaussian statistics holds and factorial moments $F_q$ are equal to unity for all orders $q$. Correlations between particles lead to a broadening of the multiplicity distribution and to dynamical fluctuations. In this case, the factorial moments increase above 1 with decreasing $\Delta$. This corresponds to what can be called intermittency. In this letter, we show that a similar analysis can be developed on financial price series, with an adequate definition of factorial moments. An intermittent behavior can be extracted using moments of order 2 ($F_2$), illustrating a sensitivity to non-Gaussian fluctuations within time resolution below 4 hours. This confirms that correlations between price returns start to play a role when the time resolution is below this threshold.",991,2011,,arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,14.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5596v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.5596v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5596v1,1108.5596v1

Both for physics and finance, we illustrate that correlations between particles lead to a broadening of the multiplicity distribution and to dynamical fluctuations when the resolution becomes small enough. From the generating function of factorial moments, we make a prediction on the gap probability for sequences of returns of positive or negative signs. The gap is defined as the number of consecutive positive returns after a negative return, thus this is a gap in negative return. Inversely for a gap in positive return. Then, the gap probability is shown to be exponentially suppressed within the gap size.

Dynamical Hurst exponent as a tool to monitor unstable periods in financial time series,"Raffaello Morales, T. Di Matteo, Ruggero Gramatica, Tomaso Aste",4,"We investigate the use of the Hurst exponent, dynamically computed over a moving time-window, to evaluate the level of stability/instability of financial firms. Financial firms bailed-out as a consequence of the 2007-2010 credit crisis show a neat increase with time of the generalized Hurst exponent in the period preceding the unfolding of the crisis. Conversely, firms belonging to other market sectors, which suffered the least throughout the crisis, show opposite behaviors. These findings suggest the possibility of using the scaling behavior as a tool to track the level of stability of a firm. In this paper, we introduce a method to compute the generalized Hurst exponent which assigns larger weights to more recent events with respect to older ones. In this way large fluctuations in the remote past are less likely to influence the recent past. We also investigate the scaling associated with the tails of the log-returns distributions and compare this scaling with the scaling associated with the Hurst exponent, observing that the processes underlying the price dynamics of these firms are truly multi-scaling.",1123,2011,"Physica A 391, 2012, 3180-3189",arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,14.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0465v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.0465v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0465v1,1109.0465v1

The first technique establishes a threshold above which connections are considered affected by noise, based on the study of random networks with the same probability density distribution of the original data. The second technique is to judge the strengh of a connection by its survival rate, which is the amount of time a connection between two stock market indices endure. The idea is that true connections will survive for longer periods of time, and that random connections will not. That information is then combined with the information obtained from the first technique in order to create a smaller network, where most of the connections are either strong or enduring in time.",918,2011,Physica A 391 (2012) 2678-2711,arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,14.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0642v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.0642v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0642v1,1109.0642v1

It is further hypothesized that statistical evidence can be found for various relations between several types of trends and the direction of the next movements of the prices. These hypotheses are tested on the historical data of the DJIA (Dow) and confirmed.

Super-exponential endogenous bubbles in an equilibrium model of rational and noise traders,"T. Kaizoji, M. Leiss, A. Saichev, D. Sornette",4,"We introduce a model of super-exponential financial bubbles with two assets (risky and risk-free), in which rational investors and noise traders co-exist. Rational investors form expectations on the return and risk of a risky asset and maximize their constant relative risk aversion expected utility with respect to their allocation on the risky asset versus the risk-free asset. Noise traders are subjected to social imitation and follow momentum trading. Allowing for random time-varying herding propensity, we are able to reproduce several well-known stylized facts of financial markets such as a fat-tail distribution of returns and volatility clustering. In particular, we observe transient faster-than-exponential bubble growth with approximate log-periodic behavior and give analytical arguments why this follows from our framework. The model accounts well for the behavior of traders and for the price dynamics that developed during the dotcom bubble in 1995-2000.

Time Scales in Futures Markets and Applications,Laurent Schoeffel,1,"The probability distribution of log-returns for financial time series, sampled at high frequency, is the basis for any further developments in quantitative finance. In this letter, we present experimental results based on a large set of time series on futures. We show that the t-distribution with $\nu \simeq 3$ gives a nice description of almost all data series considered for a time scale $\Delta t$ below 1 hour. For $\Delta t \ge 8$ hours, the Gaussian regime is reached. A particular focus has been put on the DAX and Euro futures. This appears to be a quite general result that stays robust on a large set of futures, but not on any data sets. In this sense, this is not universal. A technique using factorial moments defined on a sequence of returns is described and similar results for time scales are obtained. Let us note that from a fundamental point of view, there is no clear reason why DAX and Euro futures should present similar behavior with respect to their return distributions. Both are complex markets where many internal and external factors interact at each instant to determine the transaction price. These factors are certainly different for an index on a change parity (Euro) and an index on stocks (DAX). Thus, this is striking that we can identify universal statistical features in price fluctuations of these markets. This is really the advantage of micro-structure analysis to prompt unified approaches of different kinds of markets. Finally, we examine the relation of power law distribution of returns with another scaling behavior of the data encoded into the Hurst exponent.

Non-Gaussianity of the Intraday Returns Distribution: its evolution in time,M. A. Virasoro,1,We find a remarkable time persistence of various proxies for the kurtosis (p-kurtosis) of the intraday returns distribution for the S&P500 index and this permits a significant measure of their evolution from 1983 to 2004. There appears a long time scale dramatic variation of the p-kurtosis uncorrelated with the variation of the volatility thus falsifying any hypothesis of a universal shape for the probability distribution of the returns. A large increase in the kurtosis anticipates the October 87 crash. During the years 1991-2003 it continuously decreases even when the volatility grows during the dot-com bubble.

The topology of cross-border exposures: beyond the minimal spanning tree approach,"Alessandro Spelta, Tanya Araújo",2,"The recent financial crisis has stressed the need to understand financial systems as networks of interdependent countries, where cross-border financial linkages play the fundamental role. It has also been emphasized that the relevance of these networks relies on the representation of changes follow-on the occurrence of stress events. Adopting a topological approach we are able to address the role that network structures play in the spread of shocks and conversely, the effectiveness of stress events and its impact on the structure of the networks. Here, from series of interbank liabilities and claims over different time periods, we have developed networks of positions (net claims) between countries. Besides the Minimal Spanning Tree analysis of the time-constrained networks, a coefficient of residuality is defined to capture the structural evolution of the network of cross-border financial linkages. Because some structural changes seem to be related to the role that countries play in the financial context, networks of debtor and creditor countries are also developed. Empirical results allows to relate the network structure that emerges in the last years to the globally turbulent period that has characterized financial systems since the latest nineties. The residuality coefficient highlights an important modification acting in the financial linkages across countries in the period 1997-2011, and situates the recent financial crises as replica of a larger structural change going on since 1997.",1514,2011,,arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,14.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5711v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.5711v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5711v1,1112.5711v1
Random matrix approach to the dynamics of stock inventory variations,"W. -X. Zhou, G. -H. Mu, J. Kertész",3,"We study the cross-correlation matrix $C_{ij}$ of inventory variations of the most active individual and institutional investors in an emerging market to understand the dynamics of inventory variations. We find that the distribution of cross-correlation coefficient $C_{ij}$ has a power-law form in the bulk followed by exponential tails and there are more positive coefficients than negative ones. In addition, it is more possible that two individuals or two institutions have stronger inventory variation correlation than one individual and one institution. We find that the largest and the second largest eigenvalues ($\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$) of the correlation matrix cannot be explained by the random matrix theory and the projection of inventory variations on the first eigenvector $u(\lambda_1)$ are linearly correlated with stock returns, where individual investors play a dominating role. The investors are classified into three categories based on the cross-correlation coefficients $C_{VR}$ between inventory variations and stock returns. Half individuals are reversing investors who exhibit evident buy and sell herding behaviors, while 6% individuals are trending investors. For institutions, only 10% and 8% investors are trending and reversing investors. A strong Granger causality is unveiled from stock returns to inventory variations, which means that a large proportion of individuals hold the reversing trading strategy and a small part of individuals hold the trending strategy. Comparing with the case of Spanish market, Chinese investors exhibit common and market-specific behaviors.

Understanding the source of multifractality in financial markets,"Jozef Barunik, Tomaso Aste, Tiziana Di Matteo, Ruipeng Liu",4,"In this paper, we use the generalized Hurst exponent approach to study the multi- scaling behavior of different financial time series. We show that this approach is robust and powerful in detecting different types of multiscaling. We observe a puzzling phenomenon where an apparent increase in multifractality is measured in time series generated from shuffled returns, where all time-correlations are destroyed, while the return distributions are conserved. This effect is robust and it is reproduced in several real financial data including stock market indices, exchange rates and interest rates. In order to understand the origin of this effect we investigate different simulated time series by means of the Markov switching multifractal (MSM) model, autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) processes with stable innovations, fractional Brownian motion and Levy flights. Overall we conclude that the multifractality observed in financial time series is mainly a consequence of the characteristic fat-tailed distribution of the returns and time-correlations have the effect to decrease the measured multifractality.",1141,2012,"Physica A, 391 (17), pp. 4234-4251 (2012)",arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,13.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1535v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.1535v2.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1535v2,1201.1535v2
The class of nonlinear stochastic models as a background for the bursty behavior in financial markets,"Vygintas Gontis, Aleksejus Kononovicius, Stefan Reimann",3,"We investigate large changes, bursts, of the continuous stochastic signals, when the exponent of multiplicativity is higher than one. Earlier we have proposed a general nonlinear stochastic model which can be transformed into Bessel process with known first hitting (first passage) time statistics. Using these results we derive PDF of burst duration for the proposed model. We confirm analytical expressions by numerical evaluation and discuss bursty behavior of return in financial markets in the framework of modeling by nonlinear SDE.",538,2012,"Advances in Complex Systems 15 (1), 2012, 1250071",arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,13.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3083v3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.3083v3.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3083v3,1201.3083v3
Survivability and centrality measures for networks of financial market indices,Leonidas Sandoval Junior,1,"Using data from 92 indices of stock exchanges worldwide, I analize the cluster formation and evolution from 2007 to 2010, which includes the Subprime Mortgage Crisis of 2008, using asset graphs based on distance thresholds.

Co-movement of energy commodities revisited: Evidence from wavelet coherence analysis,"Lukas Vacha, Jozef Barunik",2,"In this paper, we contribute to the literature on energy market co-movement by studying its dynamics in the time-frequency domain. The novelty of our approach lies in the application of wavelet tools to commodity market data. A major part of economic time series analysis is done in the time or frequency domain separately. Wavelet analysis combines these two fundamental approaches allowing study of the time series in the time- frequency domain. Using this framework, we propose a new, model-free way of estimating time-varying cor- relations. In the empirical analysis, we connect our approach to the dynamic conditional correlation approach of Engle (2002) on the main components of the energy sector. Namely, we use crude oil, gasoline, heating oil, and natural gas on a nearest-future basis over a period of approximately 16 and 1/2 years beginning on November 1, 1993 and ending on July 21, 2010. Using wavelet coherence, we uncover interesting dynamics of correlations between energy commodities in the time-frequency space.",1032,2012,"Energy Economics 34(1), pp. 241--247 (2012)",arXiv Statistical Finance,0,0,0,0,13.5,Statistical Finance,q-fin.ST,https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4776v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.4776v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4776v1,1201.4776v1
On Hurst exponent estimation under heavy-tailed distributions,"Jozef Barunik, Ladislav Kristoufek",2,"In this paper, we show how the sampling properties of the Hurst exponent methods of estimation change with the presence of heavy tails. We run extensive Monte Carlo simulations to find out how rescaled range analysis (R/S), multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA), detrending moving average (DMA) and generalized Hurst exponent approach (GHE) estimate Hurst exponent on independent series with different heavy tails. For this purpose, we generate independent random series from stable distribution with stability exponent {\alpha} changing from 1.1 (heaviest tails) to 2 (Gaussian normal distribution) and we estimate the Hurst exponent using the different methods. R/S and GHE prove to be robust to heavy tails in the underlying process. GHE provides the lowest variance and bias in comparison to the other methods regardless the presence of heavy tails in data and sample size. Utilizing this result, we apply a novel approach of the intraday time-dependent Hurst exponent and we estimate the Hurst exponent on high frequency data for each trading day separately. We obtain Hurst exponents for S&P500 index for the period beginning with year 1983 and ending by November 2009 and we discuss the surprising result which uncovers how the market's behavior changed over this long period.",1298,2012,"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications (2010), 389

Asymmetric correlation matrices: an analysis of financial data,"Giacomo Livan, Luca Rebecchi",2,"We analyze the spectral properties of correlation matrices between distinct statistical systems. Such matrices are intrinsically non symmetric, and lend themselves to extend the spectral analyses usually performed on standard Pearson correlation matrices to the realm of complex eigenvalues. We employ some recent random matrix theory results on the average eigenvalue density of this type of matrices to distinguish between noise and non trivial correlation structures, and we focus on financial data as a case study. Namely, we employ daily prices of stocks belonging to the American and British stock exchanges, and look for the emergence of correlations between two such markets in the eigenvalue spectrum of their non symmetric correlation matrix. We find several non trivial results, also when considering time-lagged correlations over short lags, and we corroborate our findings by additionally studying the asymmetric correlation matrix of the principal components of our datasets.",989,2012,"Eur.
